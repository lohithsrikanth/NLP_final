            "85 degrees is always a good spot to curb any of your doughy sweet bun cravings. This location is hard to beat, situated in the heart of Spring Mountain is a newly developed plaza. Inside is clean, organized and spacious...I could only wish the full establishment was open to experience. Of course, because of our friend COVID, all the buns are individually packaged which is not the same experience we are normally used to. For going towards the closing minutes, there was still plenty of buns to choose from. And with that said let me tell you which ones I picked... Strawberry Cream Tart (3.5/5) - The tart was a good size, just that perfect mouthful. Simple enough to curb your fruit tart craving, but not enough wow to give the full 5 star review. The crust was tasty and had a good crunch, maybe a little too much if I were to be picky. Strawberries were perfect rip with the perfect amount of glaze. Wish I had a couple more strawberries to compliment the abundantly cold cream. I did appreciate the nice little box they used to package the individual tart. Sugar Cream Cheese Brioche Bun (4/5) - this bun is soft, airy yet doughy. The cream cheese is the perfect compliment with the hard sugar sprinkles. Probably something I imagine pairing with coffee/tea, not so much a dessert bun. Coffee Milk Butter Bun (4.5/5) - nice airy, soft, chewy texture. The flavors hits you on all side. Sweet, savory, with a espresso follow up. Good amount of filling and the chocolate chips are always fun. Ideal treat for the coffee lover. Strawberry White Chocolate (5/5) - if you like that old school strawberry shortcake flavor, this is it. Barely has a white chocolate taste. Bun it's soft, fluffy and buttery. Definitely would be my first pick of buns. Taro Swirl Bun (4.5/5) - If you ever imagined a perfectly baked bun, this is it. The bun has a nice crisp top layer married to a nice fluffy body encompassing a sweet taro custard. If you're a taro lover, you will love this. And if you're not a taro lover, this will make you a believer. Chocolate Croissant (3.5/5) - just your standard chocolate croissant. No eventful \"wow\" presence. The dough is a solid buttery croissant but I'd only call it a step above the ones from Starbucks. Would I get it again? Probably, but not any of my top 5 choices. Overall a 4.9 so I'm rounding up to an easy 5-stars. I'm happy and so is my stomach.",
            "Life looks wonderful and beautiful through another's eyes! Know that YOU have meaning, life should be lived one happy moment at a time. Discover what makes your life happy! For me, please, coffee; is how to begin anew and renewed each and every day. The staff here makes a mean cup of your have to go try caffeinated beverage. If your not a caffeine addict, they sell the milk teas with an extra amazing assortment of boba flavors. This review is post COVID, so many changes have taken place in our world. Health is paramount, now that 85 degrees is open it's time to support our favorite bakery. To keep you \"the customer health,\" everything is pre packaged now. Rest assured everything is baked in house with proper safety procedures followed. The store is always clean beyond what is called for. Did you see that speck of dirt anywhere? Nope, neither did I ! Thank you crew and staff of 85 Degrees for making my health happiness great. The joy of life should be especially importantly enough-right! When we think long and hard on it! What about when life throws those unexpectedly off? That curve ball out of right field. How about that birthday that you need a cake for with one hours notice? Can you possibly make a deadline like that; and it still turn out \"golden!\" Indeed it can. Make epic parties and be the talk of your little circle. The 85 degree bakery sells cakes that are made with no notice. They are delicious too! They even provide the knife to cut it with. As an added touch purchase a chocolate happy birthday marker moment too! The variety and flavors will honestly surprise and surpass your cake needs expectations; especially on short notice. How do I know about cakes in an hour? Or on the fly! Between the life that I pull off, it's always busy busy! This for work, a dog, a twin, then work calls again; you get the idea. My bestie needed her cake and I was going to make it and all it home. Then I fell asleep! I remembered that 85 degrees does some of the best cakes I've seen. You need no notice they are positioned behind glass ready to be taken to your function. The pricing is no issues either. A larger cake will run under $50. The adornments are so beautiful and appealing to the eye. When you taste that first bite of your fabulous cake that price will just melt away with the icing under your tongue. The strawberries tiramisu is so smooth and decadent. You will be taking seconds and thirds wondering where the cake went; it's so damn delicious. Now if it's just the bakery needs of breads and pastries it's all here awaiting your selection. So many versions of sweet breads and cakes. There are still many to choose from, but not like prior to COVID. You are still able to shop for your own purchase of bread and pastries. They are again all individually wrapped with perfect care and joy. As you shop employees of the bakery are restocking what customers are buying. Usually, a line is always gathered outside. With the COVID restrictions relaxed for now up to about fifteen individuals can be in the store. Remember the mask you cannot shop in the store without it, regardless of vaccine status. Now we have the place to cake. Dessert should be taken very seriously. Trust the crew of 85 degrees to make that special moment super. Have epic moments all the time. It does not take a special occasion to have a slice of cake. Sure, maybe you should share your favorite dessert! Maybe not! No judgement here. Let's dessert together in harmony. Get that strawberries boba drink with extra whip to go for a limited time I've heard. I have dessert waiting and it needs extra special attention. Remember your incredible and unique because you are YOU! Now have cake and make it all better! I've heard pie can change life moments too!",
            "Stopped by on 1/21 as it was near a place I was at. I wanted some breakfast and decided to give it a try. The location was clean, with items being restocked and rotated throughout. There were plenty of items out at 9:30am, with the option to order your drink ahead via a kiosk before selecting all your pastries. I opted for a Matcha Bun that had chocolate in it. A Twist that had raisins and a sweet filling, and also a bacon cheese roll. All of the items were individually wrapped, with things still available to pick up things. I did like this but I do think it's quite wasteful with all the added plastic. As I was checking out, I added a Rose Milk tea (hot) to my order. My total was $10 which wasn't bad for 4 items. The tea came out fairly quickly so I didn't have to wait and the cashier was quick too in checking me out. The Matcha Choco Bun - normally I don't like filled buns (not into the creams inside) but this was actually quite good! Not overly sweet and good texture. The Coconut Twist - I was surprised to find raisins inside as I didn't expect that but it was good and the filling was good as well! Not too much of a coconut flavor, however, it paired perfect with a warm drink. Rose Milk Tea - this was ok, not the best I've ever had but good! The flavor wasn't too artificial (some rose flavored drinks tend to taste like bitter petals) but this drink was balanced well in flavor profile. I do wish they had more combinations as I like rose with match. Bacon and Cheese Bun - I ended up eating this the next day (right before typing this). I microwaved it for about 15 seconds in the plastic bag, and it's so soft and perfect! Very delicious and not stale at all considering I had it a day later. I would definitely buy this again next time! I recommend giving this bakery a try!",
            "So this is one I've been waiting for and I am excited that I get to finally review it. Ambiance: The decor is fairly the same as the ones that I have seen in California. I mean it is a franchise so no surprise there and no complaints. There's a good amount of cases for people to go to when choosing what they want to grab and the line weaves its way through. Service: Now service was good. There was a lot of people when I went so there was a bit of a wait but compared with the amount of people it definitely was not to bad. Service was fairly quick so no complaints. A girl named Kiara was our cashier and she was nice, quick, and when my mom asked if they had Taro bread she kindly offered to grab us a couple before it made its way to the cases which I did appreciate. Food: This is always the highlight. I never have any complaint and this is the same. My personal favorites are the Taro marble bread, egg tarts, and chocolate bread. The taro bread is always nice and subtle. Chocolate bread was good with some powder sugar on the top. The egg tarts are always a big one for me because the crust is always so flakey and the filling is sweet. A new favorite I've come to add is if you're looking for something on the savory side their Kale spinach danish definitely make my tummy happy. Overall, I'm glad we finally have one in our city. Only thing that I wasn't pleased with was the wait just because if you've been to other 85's then you know they're pretty quick but I'm sure they'll get faster once they fully settle in. In love and will be coming here a lot more in the future!",
            "I've been wanting to check out this place for a bit! It's quite an interesting concept and all the baked goods you could imagine! When you walk in, you grab a tray, liner, tongs and whatever your heart desires. Brings you back to the good ole days of being at a cafeteria when you're a kid, instead this time, everything is delicious sweets! Seriously, they have so many delicious sweets to select from. I saw a chocolate hazelnut muffin and instantly gravitated towards that. I indulge in sweets every now and then, but I can't just only eat that, so I just got one to try. They also have coffee that looks delicious too but I had just come from another coffee shop so I decided to pass on that for now. I was surprised to see how cheap everything was. I think I paid maybe less than $3 for everything. I got a water cup, too, which they do charge for, but it was only like $.25. After you make your way through the sweet treats to grab, you then make your way through the line. The line today went pretty quick but it was also a Friday morning so that could be why. They have a lot of space for that line, so my guess is that it's usually packed. But, I also saw that they have a little kiosk that you could use to check out, too, which honestly I probably could have done today. Will try that out next time. I'd love to come back here and indulge even more in their delicious sweets. I really loved that muffin and though it was pretty tasty."

            "I'm considered by many (and myself) to be a food snob. That doesn't mean the food has to be uppity, Michelin star quality. It just has to be done right, with proper ingredients, and proper preparation. Amelie's delivers on all of this. I can't believe it's taken me 2 years to find this place since they opened. I've only been there a hand full of times so far, but my goal is to try everything on their menu and in their case at least once (and not gain a ton in the process). Their soups are very flavorful. I tasted the Tomato Fennel which had a very surprising and pleasant spice to it (heat spice, just a little bit). I ordered it but when it came time to deliver they were out. I happily substituted the Portabello and Caramelized Onion with Goat Cheese, which I regretted not asking for a sample of to begin with. Very flavorful broth, and I loved the small chunks of goat cheese. My boyfriend had the Spinach, Asparagus, and Leek soup which was very light and flavorful. I've also had the Thai Sweet Potato which was exceptional in flavor. A hint of curry, chunks of sweet potato. I enjoy that none of the soups are served scalding hot and come with a portion of baguette. Sandwiches have been phenomenal. I would typically never order roast beef, but after trying the Seeded Roast Beef I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. Perfect amount of horseradish and served warm. The Croque Monseiur lived up to my expectations, as I spent about 24 hours in anticipation dreaming about ordering it for dinner that night. Perfectly crisped brioche with melted Gruyere on top... just yum. The desserts and pastries.... wow. As someone with a degree in culinary arts who has taken her fair share of baking courses, I fully appreciate the difficulty, complexity, and time involved in baking true French confections. I appreciate that Amelie's does not try to put their own spin on much, rather represent true French cuisine. They do it very well. The eclairs are better than any I've had, and I do enjoy their chocolate bavarian cream filled (one of their few unique twists). The chocolate hazelnut tart is dense and rich, as is one of their small chocolate tort offerings. The coconut macaroons are crispy on the outside and perfectly chewy on the inside. Salted caramel brownies are to die for.... just insanely dense, fudgy, with a delightfully smooth and creamy caramel on top. No wonder it's an award winner. The cherry turnover had a spot-on flaky crust, but I wish their had been more whole cherries in the filling. Their blueberry and cream cheese danish is hands down the most amazing danish I've had in my life. Other danish do not deserve to use the name. In addition to the food, you can't beat the atmosphere. It has a good, positive feel to it and the scenery is always changing. It's a diverse crowd and the owners are very nice people. I kind of wish they had cappuccino/espressos, but now I'm just getting very picky. Add in the fact that they're open 24/7, and it's definitely a favorite in my book. The price is absolutely fair for the quality of food.",
            "So as someone smart once said: I think, therefore I Amelie's. I absolutely love this Cafe. It's wonderful. It's the saving grace of Charlotte for me, and it's what tips the scales and makes me actually want to hang out here on a regular basis. I'm serious - and not even because of the pastries and shizz. Basically you have a place that has excellent coffee products (not cheap tho) and tasty pastries (a little overpriced for Charlotte, more like NYC prices, but a very good standard) with free Wi-Fi and a decent amount of outlets, and fairly comfortable rooms (lots and lots of rooms, all of them interesting and intimate and full of cuties at any old time of day), and plenty of space and tons of sexy people coming in at night - and I mean tons... don't get me started on the sexy people in the daytime, and not just my Barbie. And this place is open 24 hours a day and they have no problem with me hanging out here for six or seven hours and doing all of my Yelp stuffs online, although I did spend a decent amount of money here too, but I don't think they would have cared even if I hadn't. They have gender-neutral restrooms and a generally liberal attitude, and it's just a wonderful place with a great French theme, and there are several of them now, including the 6th or 7th location which is the first outside CLT, and of course it's in CLT's role model... Atlanta. The one in the downtown is really nice too, but this will always be my favourite because it is 24 hours and it rocks. There's just one major problem and it was pretty major for me, which was that after staying here all night I was like an icicle. I was totally frozen. The temperature wasn't too awful at 2 or 3 in the morning but once it got to six and seven and eight I was shivering profusely from the cold. I went to the car shaking like a leaf at 8:15 a.m. and continue to shake, and needed some heatblasting action. But they have pretty decent key lime Tarts and really good mixed berry tarts, and that salted coffee drink that the one dude gave me which is one of the lattes I think - the bottom one on the list, and the one that he recommended over my initial choice - was spectacular and I would order it again and again and again, and will do. So thank you for the wonderful guy who I think was possibly hitting on me, for being a real angel and making me get this expensive drink, because it was the highlight of my stay here and it helped me get all my sh** done more or less. In other words all the Yelp reviews written before the pictures expired. I'll be back here again pretty soon, which is funny because I first came here when on tour for my music a decade ago, and slept out front without ever going in. I'm glad I finally rectumfied that. And as I've said, it's not difficult to gain weight from these products. In fact I do it with great Amel-ease. This review is true, or my name's not SAM LEE And my shaved body and tan aren't MANLY They're full of French pastries and they treat you like FAMILY And everything is cheap, or my name's not STANLEY I used to live in LA, in the San Fernando VALLEY My creepy room-mates used to call me sleazy SALLY I wanted to find a good bakery very BADLY But there was nothing French and really yummy, SADLY Then I was way down in a town called MIAMI Where the girls are so hot, so I would return, GLADLY But I asked for French baked goods, and they refused FLATLY And yelled at me in a way not unlike Gordon RAMSEY So I drove up to Carolina using Rand MCNALLY And the resemblance of this bakery to France is UNCANNY If I keep getting naked in their lobby they might BAN ME But I hope not because I love the pastries at AMELIE'S WHAT!",
            "This is my favorite bakery of all time (and I have tried many!). I think that the constant crowd at all hours of the day is proof that this place is amazing! When I first walked in, my eyes almost glazed over and my salivary glands kicked into overdrive at the sight of the very long glass display case of pastries. They were all beautiful and obviously artfully made by people that know what they are doing. If you couldn't find a pastry here to completely satisfy your visual and gustatory senses, there might just be something wrong with you. Also, the eclectic feel is very welcoming and sure to make you feel like have teleported to Paris. But don't be fooled, it isn't just the pastries that have people coming back to Amelie's, the actual food is to die for too! I have tried the ham and gruyere tartine and the sweet potato soup. The tartine had the perfect amount of very good quality cheese and the baguette that supported it was crispy but delicious. It is also a perfect portion and not very expensive. The soup was very smooth and had a perfect balance of flavors. I love sweet potatoes and I think they nailed this variation of sweet potato soup. It is perfect for a cold day! I tried the vanilla eclair and an assorted fruit mini tart. The tart was the perfect size and there were so many varieties that all looked picture perfect and fresh. The crust was not too sweet but perfect to compliment the custard interior and the fresh fruit on top. The chocolate eclair was very large and not quite the shape of others I have had before. However, the custard was delicious and there was lots of it! You can even have an eclair customized for Valentine's Day which I might be requesting next year. I have heard that the salted caramel brownie is out of this world from all of my friends and I will definitely be making the trip soon to try this and a few more of their pastries! I hope to become an Amelie's connoisseur!",
            "The original, the wonderful, the delicious Amelie's of NoDa. This place has been open since 2008 and it's no surprise that they have thrived in the years since. The outstanding quality of their food paired with top notch customer service has turned them into somewhat of a confectionery juggernaut around the Queen City. Amelie's now operates six total shops with four in Charlotte NC, one in Rock Hill SC, and one in Atlanta GA. I have personally visited three of the six locations and can attest to them maintaining their standards on all fronts. A Macaron in NoDa is going to taste exactly the same as a Macaron in Park Rd. Speaking of Macarons, those are just one of dozens, if not hundreds, of options to choose from. Cakes, pies, tarts, puffs, cookies, croissants, muffins, breads. If it can be baked, they probably have it. Some of my personal favorites are the Chocolate Petite Gateau, the Twice Baked Almond Croissant, the Pecan Tartlet and the Sea Salted Caramel Brownie. I would normally go through and try to describe to you what flavors and textures made each of these items so good, but you're really just better off trying them yourself. Imagine a delicious treat you fancy. Got it pictured? Now head on over to Amelie's. Do they have it? Probably, and if so, I would bet its at least as good if not better than the one you'd get from whatever place you imagined. They really are that good. They are a cafe as well as a bakery, so they have an assortment of fresh made savory fair as well, though I admittedly have only tried the sweet stuff. (I have heard good things from friends though.) Amelie's is usually a special occasion dessert stop for me. Their per item prices aren't really going to break your bank, but if you decide you want to bring home a whole box of goodies for the family and friends it can get a little expensive. A Macaron is just over $2 and a Petite Gateau is just under $6, to give a frame of reference. Quality does come at a price, but I'm happy to pay it. I could sit here and tell you about Amelie's all day. The unique decor at each location, the splendid treats of all shapes and sizes, the fact that they are open late, with the original location being open 24/7/365. You need to decide for yourself if I'm just rambling or if they really are as good as I claim. I have never had a bad experience at one of their shops, with the biggest downside being an occasional line during peak hours. I hope my words are enough to at least pique your interest, but Amelie's is something best experienced in person. The next time you visit, eat a croissant for me!",
            "Some things are so good that it's wise you keep it at arms length. I'd have to say that Amelie's falls into that foodie category. Between the pastries, eclectic crowd, creative decor and 24-hour access, I'm pretty sure I'd be a blimp if I lived in N. Davidson! I'm visiting Charlotte this week and hanging with the TonyaP so I knew this place HAD to be good. We popped in last night and there was a line snaking in front of the counter but not to worry, it moves quickly. I stuck my head into the side room and was amazed at what I saw: antiqued furniture, high ceilings and lush fabrics. Everything at Amelie's falls under creative, shabby chic! Loved the overhead light piece shrouded by stainless steel cups, graters and other kitchen items. My eyes immediately got drawn to the lit pastry case where my visual tummy was dazzled by the array of delectable sweets. Pecan pie, fruit tarts, napoleons, eclairs and more, me wants it all! I took it \"easy\" ordering up three items and everything was boxed up for us. But if you know Tonya or myself, we are NOT gonna wait. Plopped ourselves down on some stools and dug in. That pecan pie was wonderful, full of nuts to counteract the rich, sweet filling. And a great sweet crust that wasn't over-baked. One of the best pecan pies I've had since it was more nutty than usual, I tried to hog it all up but shared a bite with my Yelp host. I was buzzing with the sugar so I wisely held off on the peach tart and sea salt brownie until laters... Seriously good baked goods, there's a lot of love and talent being placed into their product here. Update: Finally ate the sea salt caramel brownie and it was UNBELIEVABLE! What can I say but Amelie's rocked it out for me! This bakery would do well in any urban center including San Francisco, call me impressed. So Charlotte, enjoy Amelie's for everything it's got. I for one am totally jealous that you've got this amazingly tempting bakery here. Thankfully I'm 150 miles away, Amelie! We'll have to have a long-distance relationship, girl..."

            "Oh dear Batch. It's such a good thing you are on the complete opposite side of town from me. Otherwise I would be one enormous unhealthy person. Everything here is ridiculously delicious. And I agree with the other reviewers-the various croissants are the closest thing I've come to outside of Paris (and I've tried my fair share across the USA!). Their latest creation, the cini-mini is absurdly good and I'm not even much of a cinnamon sugar treat fan. The Gruyere croissant is easily one of the best things I've ever eaten and while Batch may be far from the far west side, this delectable treat is available at the West Towne Metcalfe's (weekends only and you better go early!) as well as Willy Street West. Yummmmm. The olive fougasse (sp?) is also super delicious. But why bother saying that cuz everything here is super delicious. There is always a wide variety of sweet and savory, various fruit flavors (oh the mini sunny lemon, oh yes! The mini sunny lemon) as well as chocolate and non-chocolate delights. All this plus bread, filled rolls, great coffee and a small refrigerated case near the register with mini-key lime pies and the prettiest little cookie sandwiches I've ever seen. Oh yeah, and the people who work there are extremely patient as I stare and drool and try to decide what not to purchase this time. That's right, what NOT to buy. Cuz if left up to me and no one was looking, I'd eat one (or two) of everything in the case. And that's saying something cuz the selection is huge (as long as you go before 10ish on the weekends!). Just do yourself a favor and go.",
            "My coworker has been raving about Batch Bakehouse for years, but I never take him too seriously because his recommendations are often hit or miss. Well, I finally stopped by 2 months ago and have been a fan ever since! I can tell Batch is well loved by the Madison community because there's been a long line out the door every time I've visited. They have a large assortment of baked goods, but you'll be left with limited pickings if you show up by noon. My personal favorite is the ham and gruyere cheese croissant. The first time I saw it, I was put off by the price and told myself \"this better be the best croissant I've ever tasted\". It was! One of the flakiest croissants I've ever had, filled with delicious warm goodies inside. I'm salivating just writing this. They've also got a delicious pumpkin cookie; it's honestly more like a mini cake but you can reallytaste the pumpkin, and it's one of my partner's favorite things to order. Overall, I love Batch Bakehouse! They're on the pricier side, but they've got some delicious treasures that makeme keep going back!",
            "Batch bakehouse has so many wonderful pastry and other baked good options! I got the almond chocolate croissant, which was so delicious. The almond icing on the top makes it a much sweeter pastry, but I am generally never one to say \"no\" to more sugar, so it worked for me. And, the almond chocolate croissant was the same price as the regular chocolate one ($3.25). Overall, the croissant was a great mix of flaky on the outside and soft on the inside... yum!! The bakery is in an adorable area, has friendly staff and nice, bright lighting! A great place to stop in for a treat or meet a friend to enjoy some delicious Madison sweets.",
            "I am putting this out there: I feel like I am totally out of place by only rating them a 4/5. This could be because I have only tried two things...so far. I walk in to expect a super overwhelming, packed store. It was not. Point for Batch. I did not expect the amount of variety in absolutely everything. I read the reviews so I thought I was prepared. Man. I had to walk by about 5 times to officially decide and determine my order. I finally decided on the apple pie ($3.75) and the caramelized onion focaccia ($4?). I ate the pie in my car...I could not wait to take it home. The pie was full of cinnamon, a denser crust and lots of apples. It tasted ok. It tasted like a pie. I think I was so hyped that I expected the pie beyond pies. I am glad to know another place where I can get pie but it also makes it very tempting to try and perfect my own apple pie and save almost $4.00. Again, do not get me wrong, it is a good pie but was not OMG good. The focaccia was good. That one did make it home and the sig. other actually enjoyed it and he is picky. I like onions. I think a cheese on top would have made it Super Duper focaccia but at that point does that still mean it is focaccia or closer to a sandwich? Either way, it was good. I will for sure be going back to try the endless supply of goodies. I am still in search of my OMG pie but this pie would do for a good eat.",
            "A little batch of heaven right here on Willy Street Over the years, I've never really had a go to bakery in Madison. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the doughnuts from Greenbush, the morning buns from Manna (and before that from Oven of Brittany) and cupcakes from Bloom. But I never had a place to go to get a wide variety of consistently delicious sweet and savory baked goods until Batch Bakehouse swept me off my feet. Things I love: * the vanilla swirl croissant a.k.a. the pastry orgasm. One bite into the flaky exterior and your eyes will roll back into your head and the satisfied moans of contentment commence. * the salted caramel brownie (see vanilla swirl description) * the passion of the staff members: I'm always warmly greeted when I walk into the store. At the old location, they always gave my daughter a free pasty if we showed up around closing time. Several of my favorite baking classes at Orange Tree Imports were taught by Batch employees. (If you want to seriously improve your game as a bread baker, sign up for these classes ASAP, don't delay!) These folks love what they do and it shines through with every item you see in the display. * the freakishly incredible variety of pastries. Check out the website for a list of what they sell. Just have a napkin ready to sop up the inevitable drooling that will commence once you start reading that list. Things I don't: * OK, the only thing I can come up with is that I would become more ginormous than Jabba the Hutt if I ate everything that looked good every time I shopped at Batch. I probably do work out a little harder on days I go to Batch just so I can add an extra item to my shopping list. Giving Batch Bakehouse a five star rating was an absolute no brainer."

            "We were getting ready to leave for the airport and wanted to get a bite to eat in the hotel before we left. It was close, on the way out to the airport and we assumed it would probably kick the crap out of any airport food you could get. Here's what we sampled: Turkey Brie Sandwich: Brie, lettuce, roast turkey, and mustard. Warmed and pressed, the bread had a texture of a ciabatta which was good, the creaminess of the brie got a little sticky and runny in the sandwich after heating it, and I liked the aroma and texture of melted brie in any way shape or form. Still, I have to admit, this didn't outstanding, it was good, but the taste wasn't any different from a sandwich that I could have made myself. Vegetable jardiniere Sandwich: With Portabello mushroom, eggplant, fennel, caramelized onions, picquillo pepper, fontina cheese and pesto. My g/f ordered this. Oh my goodness. This is the sandwich I SHOULD have ordered from the start. It is a vegetarian sandwich, but the meatiness of the mushrooms, the texture of the eggplant, with the aromatics and crisp bite from the fennel. Each bite was almost a unique cathartic experience, you had a mixture of caramelized onions, the mellow heat and body from the pepper and the melted fontina cheese was able the sit carefully on the knife edge on being flavorful and robust but also remained delicate enough it didn't overpower the sandwich. Seriously, my g/f loved this sandwich so much, it was almost impossible for me to get additional bites, I even offered her a trade on our sandwiches, where she simply smiled at me and continued eating. This was a fantastic sandwich that even me; a devote carnivore, feel as though this was a sandwich that I would be happy to eat on a regular basis. Chocolate bouchons: Their name was given due to the fact that they are shaped like the corks from bottle of wine. Without a doubt they certainly taste better then the real corks, these little morsels were rich and super moist, with little chocolate bits inside. It reminds me of a brownie, a damn good one at that. Chocolate Eclair: This was my dessert, me being the chocoholic after first glance when I saw it in the glass enclosure, I didn't stand a chance. The choux pastry dough, was light and airy, carried a light and subtle sweetness, additionally the chocolate creme patissiere was decadent and smooth, and there was a rich slathering of more chocolate right on top, creating a lovely balance with each intoxicating mouthful. Lemon Tart: My g/f's choice, and quite honestly she has bested me once again, in terms of picking the item I would get again, the lemon filling almost reminded me of a lemon curd; with all the zest that they put in you could really taste the fresh lemons, the wonderful level of acidity balanced with a creamy richness. Most notably, is the crust, here rather then to just do a pie crust or a simple graham cracker crust, they went with a fresh pine nut crust, the pine nuts created a great aroma, nutty texture with a crisp crunch. With each bite of the two elements, with their contrasting flavors, and textures melded together creating a absolutely amazing dish. It's a must try for those that have yet to experience this, and one I'll be getting next time. Parisian Macaroons Appearance wise these were stunning, I bought a couple of boxes to take back home as gifts, and even though up front they ran out, the staff were kind enough to go into the back room and make the rest to complete our order. Wonderful presentation and colors, I was told that they each had different flavors, (which included lemon, orange, strawberry, vanilla, mocha and chocolate.) Basically, we had a delay and ultimately a cancelled flight so me and my g/f may have dug into one of the boxes, you know we had to sample the gift we were giving and we did want to make sure the gift we were about to give was fresh since our next flight would be the next day. So we sampled a box. Rich, chewy and super dense, with a wonderful flavor sandwiched with a very thin layer of creme. If I had to rate it in the order of preference, it went vanilla, coffee, lemon, chocolate, strawberry and orange. Goes really well with a nice cup of plain coffee as well! The next day on our way back for attempt #2 to the airport, we stopped by one more time here and replenished the macaroons gift box that we consumed while taste testing it. So make sure next time your here go ahead and give into whatever pastries and sweets you desire just make sure don't leave without trying the lemon tart and the Vegetable jardiniere!",
            "\"Paris is always a good idea they, say!\" This line coined by Audrey Hepburn! Bouchon is the slice of Paris here in Las Vegas! The French know simple, delicious, elegant flavors of food customization options. Best kept secret in Las Vegas is Bouchon, order your food from the restaurant and dine down here by the cafe. Their is always seating, and the views are amazing. Watch the gondolas on the canals as they sail along. The endless tourists and enjoy themselves as they pass your table. Once in a great while someone will wave hello. Be polite and wave back. Your in the most beautiful spot. Umbrella over head, the beautiful Las Vegas spring breeze on your shoulder moving and messing up your hair. Let the wind toss your hair around. That coffee in my hand stimulates my mind and relaxes me. As the morning moves along I decided to have a Mimosa too. Nothing like treating your orange juice to some Champagne. Our most recent visit was for breakfast. The waffles that we enjoyed were covered with strawberries. These waffles we're so fluffy that my fork just melted all the way through as I cut them. The whip cream pairing on the side was nice since one can add as you go along. Those strawberries were fresh cut that day. Their is no butter needed on these waffles as it would break that delicious flavor balance. What is more shiny the sparkling pastries that are behind the glass shining back at ya or the smiles from the staff here. Let's easily say both. The warmth is overwhelming as you order since the staff here make the store glow with such light. I frequent Bouchon when ever in need of fabulous individuals that make me smile. The pastries are beyond irresistible. The feeling of the staff is such an incredible plus as they provide such alluring food with fantastic service. I have heard the staff here take a beating from tourists from all over. They smile and keep going. The light in the staff here never stops glowing. What an incredible place to be apart of? No wonder the pastries taste so unbelievably yummy it's all that love that is created among the employees. At least the negative comments that they receive here never take away from anyone's experience. They enhance and provide so much joy every time I visit here! What good here do many ask? Bouchon's pastries are intoxicating with such unavoidable temptation. One should watch out, truly! Once you answer the beckoning call, no other pastry will ever measure up. One of my favorites is their cheese Danish. We can of course, Salut, the French for the dough that took the world by storm because the baker made a mistake . It's all in the butter that baker so long ago forget, and ended up with a light, airy, fluffy crust that we long for so much today. The Europeans love their danish cloud and fluffy which is always full of flavor. The lighter the dough the better the taste anyways. Bouchon has not forgotten their French roots and deliver that delicious airy design pattern of making pastries that never quits. Their cheese Danish has a delicate, lightly sweetened inner core and the outer shell is breakable and cloud like. Put it together and it's a soft delightful masterpiece of exquisite expression. The primary pastries offered here practically never change, such as cheese Danish, croissant, macaroons, cinnamon rolls, donuts, and other traditional offerings. On a good week Bouchon offers Beignets that are a masterpiece of delicious happiness all in a single hole. When you can find them. The Beignets that are made here do not last very long. Truly they sell out incredibly fast. If you are ever up early with a raspberry craving now you know where to satisfy that satiating hunger. The little Beignets devils are so tempting that sin never tasted so soulful. The Beignets are filled with raspberry rouge cream that as you bite into that hole your senses tingle and twinkle a little. Sensational truly. The Beignets are sold in doubles, twice the fun. These little cinnamon and sugar coated beauties are $3.5 ! Such perfection at a cost that will leave some change for the lovely joyful crew serving up your daily love and happiness. Find you right balance. The simplest things are always the best in life. For those that crave that French way of enjoyment with the simplicity of coffee and Beignets with a beautiful view look no further. The cappuccino is fantastic here in the morning with substitutes allowed for those of us who enjoy almond milk. The crew is always in a wonderful mood provides smiles for free with the incredible deliciousness cut with a fork!",
            "I've been to the Bouchon restaurants in Beverly Hills and Las Vegas. Both experiences were okay but nothing particularly exceptional. I've read a lot of good things about the Bouchon Bakery though so I was still eager to give it a try. Bouchon Bakery is conveniently located near the guest elevators on the casino floor. The bakery is a simple open storefront. They have glass display counters showcasing the many attractive pastries and desserts while coffee is made/assembled in the background. I went three times and it was busy on each visit; still, lines moved quickly each time because service was organized. I had a good sampling of their offerings and most of what I had was good. Here is the rundown. (Pain Au Raisin) This was nice croissant dough that was mixed with golden and dark raisins. The pastry was good. It had a good crispness on the outside, but it still had a nice flakiness and softness at the center. It was nicely sweet but not overpowering. The raisins were plump and flavorful--too often raisins are overly shriveled in these types of pastries. (Chocolate Bouchon) This was a chocolate brownie shaped like a wine cork. The bouchon I had was dusted with powdered sugar. It also had a little bit of fudgy chocolate ganache in the center, which may not have been the intention (a later bouchon I had seemed to lack this fudge). The brownie was good. Good, rich chocolate flavor and the appropriate texture of a brownie. I have noticed that a lot of bakeries will alter the brownie recipe to create a moister brownie with a longer shelf life, which results in a fudgy brownie that is not really a brownie. I like how the brownie here was baked as it should have been. Because of that, the Bouchon here may not have been the moistest brownie, but it was still satisfying and thankfully still a brownie. (Macarons) I had three here--caramel, vanilla and coffee. All the flavors were good, but if I had to pick, I would probably say the caramel was the best. Good and smooth cream centers that were flavorful. The macarons' outside shells had a light crispness while the inside was soft and chewy. The macarons here were larger than most macarons I've had (priced higher too at a little over $3 a piece). (Chocolate Croissant) This (or maybe the apple croissant) was probably my least favorite thing here and it may have a lot to do with how I am not the biggest fan of chocolate croissants. I think part of it has to do with how I don't like how big and soft they tend to be. The croissant was light, crispy and flaky. The croissant featured a thick and generous chocolate bar at the center. The croissant was fine though it was very similar to the other good chocolate croissants I've had (and it did not really stand out). (Apple Croissant) This pastry was not your typical apple pastry. The bottom was a flat puff pastry base. It was topped with apples and then a slightly crunchy and sweet cinnamon streusel-like topping (similar to a Dutch apple pie). It tasted fine, but it was not as good as other apple pastries I've had. The pastry base was a little firm and thick. It lacked the light crispness and flakiness of a good croissant. The apple flavor was not as prominent as I would have liked, which was mainly due to the generous portion of the cinnamon streusel (kind of overwhelmed the apple flavor). Service was good and pleasant on all of my visits. Pricing was about what you would expect with most of the options in the $3-$4 range. I would imagine that most bakeries/pastry shops in Las Vegas (even bad ones) would be charging similar prices. The quality at Bouchon Bakery was high and because the prices were reasonable enough, this one might be worth the extra walk or the extra casino hop if you get a hankering for a good pastry during your stay. The Venetian offers complimentary valet parking. Like other major casinos, I imagine they would have complimentary self-parking as well.",
            "<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthesoloreviewer.blogspot.com%2F&s=433ba2c239a9506426b61ecf9a99769adf811d32cf7a36f5bf51a10889346cef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">thesoloreviewer.blogspot\u00a6</a> A trip to Las Vegas isn't complete without several trips to Bouchon Bakery. I stayed at the Venetian Hotel and Casino for one major reason. Thomas freaking Keller! Whether I was dining at Bouchon Bistro or snacking on treats from Bouchon Bakery, I followed Keller like a fly on a horse's butt! First trip consisted of one of there famous macaroons which I didn't see what the fuss was. I got the vanilla flavor but maybe they only taste good when they first bring them down because mine was a little on the stale side. While the vanilla cream inside was good the stale outside just ruined it. Second trip was a little more successful. I ended with the famous Thomas Keller's version of a Nutter Butter and a freshly baked Chocolate Donut with a custard filling. The Nutter Butter was good, much better than the cookie, with a peanut butter cookie on the outside and delicious peanut butter on the inside making it a perfect little treat! Move over Dunkin Donuts because I run on Thomas Keller's Donuts. Perfectly shaped donut with a wonderful custard feeling with chocolate icing and chocolate sprinkles on top. MMMMMM Donut was the only thing that kept popping in my head while eating it! If I had a Bouchon Bakery near me I would be the size of a whale. Third trip was my favorite. I got the Carrot Cake Cookie. It tasted so fresh and moist and looks just like that big cookie in the movie \"Honey I Shrunk the Kids\" that the ants were eating on. Hopefully ya'll know what I'm talking about. Just like the ants I couldn't get enough. It had that nice little spice that carrot cake has with a wonderful cream inside that reminded me of the cream in those oatmeal cookies I got growing up in my school lunches. Just a perfect cookie! Last and final trip, a tear slowly ran down my eyes while I made my final purchase, was Red Velvet Cupcake with a Citrus Frosting. While cheesecake is my favorite desert, red velvet is my second and this cupcake is the reason why. I got it as soon as they came down from baking, it was perfectly moist with a wonderfully rich cream cheese feeling inside a nice citrus frosting on top with a cute little smiley face made of chocolate chips reminding me it was Halloween. It was very rich but very good! All I can say is thank you Thomas Keller for being the genius you are and making my trip oh so sweet!",
            "I'm in Vegas. It's a place to indulge. So did I? Of course I did! I indulged on the great richness of Bouchon Bakery located in the Venetian near the guest elevators! I was staying in the Palazzo but Bouchon's was just a short 5 minute brisk walk away. I love the fact that the bakery, is just a simple and open store. It's not big and extravagent - just an open storefront you might see walking down the street in Europe. Once my friends and I got here, there were so many choices starting from breakfast items like croissants, breads to dessert like massive chocolate chip cookies, macaroons and dessert beignets! I eventually ordered: * Almond brioche - it's almost like almond brittle baked on to a nicely toasted slice of brioche. Nice and buttery. * Chocolate chip cookie - A little too sweet for me but lots of butter :) * Assortment of macaroons - I got the box set which included every flavor - strawberry, orange, pistachio, vanilla, chocolate, espresso. The box set was $17.50 which is a steal when you do the math. Individual macaroons were $3.50 each. These macaroons weren't your normal sized macaroons either, they're about 3-4 times as big which makes me gladly hand over my money for these bites of delicious goodness. * Beignets - They come at $3.75 for two so I got both flavors that they had that day, raspberry and chocolate. The raspberry one was nice and sweet but was way overfilled with too much raspberry jelly - a little hard to eat. The chocolate one was heaven - rich chocolate ganache inside of a chocolate flavored beignet with chocolate sprinkles on top. Can it get any better than that?! The macaroons were definitely the highlight of the bunch. They were sweet, crunchy, creamy and divine. I'm coming here everytime I'm in Vegas to get some Macaroons and try a few more of their delectable pastries."

            "I have no idea why this place is $$ when it really is $. Much better than Starbucks imo (i don't really care about the inspector situation because as long as they use boiling water to make their coffee I'm assuming they don't dip their hands in it afterwards). This place overshadows Starbucks as a casual hangout/study in a couple areas: 1. Much better lighting and study areas (more tables) - I'm sorry Starbucks but I absolutely hate your dimly lit areas for studying (for romantic coffee, may be better), the natural light really comes in and the store is right on the corner facing the south with huge windows so you get really good natural lighting all day long. On the downside, it's less cozy (but much better for studying!) 2. Wider selection of nondrink items. They give you two heaping scoops of gelato for $2.95 - so yummy and definitely more yogurty (less sweet deadening) than other gelato ive had. They also have really soft and fresh asian pastries, tons of sweet and salty options, and even little cups of korean bibimbaps! They also serve warm breakfast and tons of little snacks (all MUCH cheaper than Starbucks and even more delicious!) 3. Cute decor. This place is korean, so this place has got a super kawaii atmosphere about it. The music is soft and cafe-like, they have lots of little plants and books in the place - definitely gives me the feeling that I'm back in asia again (aside from almost everyone in the whole store being asian) Definitely reminds me of White Windmill back home, but with a less crowded, more brightly lit study environment.",
            "Okay so I've tried all of their teas now. Ginger twist is by far the best. Mind you, I don't contaminate tea with sugar or honey or anything like that, so it's at its purest. There are some other great options also, but ginger twist is my favorite. The only downside is that it isn't caffeinated so you might want to opt for a different type if you need that boost. Don't be shy to try their coffee, it's got an interesting little kick to it, which I really enjoy, but may not necessarily be up your alley. In terms of ambience, I LOVE studying here. It's calm and mostly quiet. Most people are running to the nearby Starbucks for their caffeine fix, which makes for lots of seating and a great atmosphere for studying. Great Starbucks alternative. Oh! Also, their food choices are WAY cheaper than Starbucks and comparatively delicious",
            "Although they've only been around for almost half a year, I think Caffebene is getting a lot better! First things first, they did lower their prices (which actually scared me off initially) and they're around the same/less than Starbucks. They're opening a new location on Green Street, so I hope they handle the first weeks better. The interior is really trendy and usually quiet, so it's a nice place to grab a cup of coffee and study. Their green tea frappe is alright. I think it's a bit too icy and Starbucks makes it better. However, the honey bread is fantastic! I got the strawberry honey bread to go and it's absolutely gorgeous how they package their food. The bread is really sweet and thick, drizzled in honey, and on top is an arrangement of strawberries in the form of a flower. I was wondering why it took so long for it to come out, but it's definitely worth the wait! Their gelato is also fantastic and they give you a lot for $2. I recommend getting the green tea or Greek yogurt flavors. They also have meal options and tons of the cutest desserts, so I definitely plan to return and try them!",
            "Over priced but solid coffee and desserts. It makes this place a \"once in a while\" \"treat yo'self\" kind of a place rather than a regular study spot. But, with that said, I love the decor, love the space, think it's great for studying to hanging out, and even think the uniforms are kind of cute in a fun way. On a student budget though it's definitely not somewhere I would go often especially when there are more reasonably priced places really close by.",
            "Caffe Bene is a place I really want to like, but I can't. The menu is shockingly expensive, it seems like most drinks start at above four dollars. For the price they are charging you'd expect amazing drinks, but unfortunately that is not the case. I've tried the pearl milk tea, which IIRC cost closer to 5 dollars, and it was unfortunately too sweet and the pearl was still hard in the center. I suspect it was not made from brewed tea but instead made from some kind of powder mix. I've also had the cafe mocha which was good, but it wasnt worth the price. Even though I think Caffe Bene is a poor value, I still enjoy my visits there. The decor is a nice switch from the other local coffeeshops, with a nice modern twist on the coffeeshop concept. This place is also brightly lit unlike some other places nearby. Additionally, the wifi is great and there are quite a few power plugs avalilable. This is a place I think I'll return to when I need to study or get things done."

            "I lived in Chicago for 20 years, and now live in Chicago. I first went to the West Side Market when I saw Michael Simon talk about Chucrazj Meats on the Food Network. I started going to the West Side Market when in town to meet up with friends when we went fishing for walleye out of Lorain, or when I was driving through town on my way from Chicago to my hometown in Rochester NY. It was an absolute MUST! This is how I discovered Campbell's. They not only have a popcorn stand with some sweet treats like marshmallows painted like Minions, but also the buckeyes there are ridiculously tasty. They also have a cupcake and treats stand there in the market as well, which is where we discovered the wedding cake \"truffles\" or as I like to call them cake balls. We love all the different flavors, but this specific one hits different. Has an almond taste, the texture of the cake is so special, and you know it's just perfect when all of your friends start begging you to bring some back. We now have a system where we call the plant up a week or more in advance of someone being in the area to pick up our order. We went fishing in Port Clinton this past weekend, so someone driving in from the Western PA in our group \"volunteered\" (we demanded he do it) to make a special order for us. We ordered 4 dozen wedding cake truffles, and 2 dozen of \"you pick it\" variety. They have M&M, Red Velvet, Chocolate peanut butter (like buckeyes), so many! So- we basically ordered 72 cake balls and one dozen buckeyes for a weekend fishing trip. There are three of us who adore this place. I am proudly the person who found it, and so I am always happy when we get a chance to get here and eat some treats! I am a type 2 diabetic, and so I have to say that it's tough not to eat my entire share of goodies when I make an order. But this time, I am giving away some of the truffles to friends here in Atlanta so they can also enjoy the goodness. Quality is so good, the pricing is what it is (thanks inflation) but we know that spending extra money on something so delicious and special is a \"treat\" and we appreciate the time spent hand making and the craftsmanship involved. Please support small businesses like Campbells. Their flavored popcorn is also pretty addictive, so be forewarned! Thank you Campbell's. I will be back, hopefully in September when we try to come back in town for more Lake Erie Walleye fishing!",
            "I love Campbell's. For me, it's a Cleveland staple. Need a hostess gift? Campbell's. Need a birthday gift? Campbell's. Not sure what to get a co-worker? Campbell's. As you can see, it's always the answer. While you may know them from inside the West Side Market, this is their HQ on West 25th Street. They're most noted for their popcorn. Initially, you'll always hear people talk about their Carmel Corn, classic Cheddar or Dichotomy. But I think their best flavors are actually the totally random ones! The Pizza popcorn literally tastes like pizza. The Cinnamon Roll is oddly good even though it might sound bizarre. Today, the salesperson convinced me to try the Oil & Vinegar and I couldn't believe how much I liked its tangy flavor. At any given moment, they also have at least 6 different popcorns you can sample from turn dispensers! They also carry delicious cake pops, truffle, brownies, chocolate covered pretzels and dipped apples. Literally, it's a sweets haven. The salespeople are super helpful and will help you find the right thing if you just exert a bit of patience during busy times. They wrap everything up in cute, pink Grandma Campbell boxes and the prices are fair for the quality. Love!!",
            "They have really good popcorn! They have cupcakes, cake pops, caramel apples, they have loads of good stuff! If you want sweets, Campbells its the place to go! My 5th grader shared the info above :) Mom's review - we have been planning a trip to Cleveland since before the pandemic and were finally able, after 2 years of waiting, to make it to this great city, and to Campbell's! What a highlight of our trip Campbell's was, and well worth the long wait. The sweet associate was incredibly friendly and helpful, personable and warm. We were surprised by the great variety of items, and managed to bring plenty back home to share with family, and we are now hooked. Thankfully Campbell's ships ;) I would highly recommend a trip here - the popcorn is so well-flavored, the caramel apples are dripping with sweetness, the cupcakes are AMAZING (putting to shame plenty of Manhattan and DC famous cupcake places), and the Buckeyes were utterly delightful!",
            "Caramel Apple, Nacho Cheese, Dichotomy, Cocoa, Banana Split all delicious treats in and of themselves but when they come in popcorn form it just makes it extra delicious! Consistency of flavor is what makes all these treats so good. They are true to their inspiration and make you wanna slap your mamma. Love, love, love them! Plus you can sample to your little hearts content. Honestly what more can you want from a store? They also offer local coffee beans, cupcakes and chocolate treats that I did not try. My obsession with Campbells is based on the popcorn alone.",
            "This place does deserve a five star. But my mind is saying give it 4. I love buying my sweets from the stands at West Side Market and I find the environment at the WSM much better. I do have to give them this though, I love both the popcorn and the cupcakes and it has better hours then WSM. Also, the interior is beautiful and really well done. I so hope that they will expand more as they definitely have a market in both Cleveland Heights and probably Westlake."

            "Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas, Carlo's Bakery! I ate at Buddy V's a couple weeks ago and one of the managers stopped at our table to check on us. After letting him know I was a \"Cake Boss\" fan, he let me know when the bakery would be opening and that contestants from \"Next Great Baker\" would be there. I obviously cleared my schedule for opening day! Carlo's Bakery (located inside The Venetian) is literally right across from Buddy V's and the pathway between them is a little more narrow than usual, so I wondered about how they were going to tame the long lines because there was no way there wouldn't be one. The grand opening was at 6 pm, so I wanted to get there early hoping to beat some of the crowd. I had my hubby and 2 nieces with me and we arrived to Carlo's Bakery around 5 pm to find a long line formed already. Venetian security had a field day with this one! We found our place at the end of the line and even though there were a lot of people in front of us, the line only grew l-o-n-g-e-r behind us. I was thankful for the spot we had after seeing just how long the line got! I appreciated that we were given samples from Carlo's employees while we waited. So let me talk about the wait. WOW! It was almost a 4 hour wait from the time we first got in line and actually got inside the bakery. I know that is a long time, but it wasn't so bad with all the activity going on around us. Between the free samples and seeing people from Next Great Baker and Cake Boss go by and stop to talk to us and take pictures, it didn't feel like 4 hours and honestly was a freaking blast! Hubby was a real trooper holding our spot in line while we would take off to get our picture with Buddy, Grace, Danny, Mary and people from NGB. Poor Buddy! He really didn't have the proper help keeping people back (like I said the pathway is a little more narrow than usual) and at one point they did have a line to meet him, but they had to stop it because so many people were crowding around and there wasn't a clear path for the people walking by who had no idea what Carlo's Bakery even was lol. At one point, Buddy came back for pictures and my nieces and I were able to get a picture. After the picture, Buddy gave one of my nieces a great big hug and a kiss on her forehead. She was SO excited smiling bright and cried a little saying \"I'm never washing my face again\" ...bless her precious young heart! They both had a blast and it's one experience they will never forget, myself included! One inside the bakery, we were greeted and the girl who helped us was very friendly and helpful. it was kind of crazy inside the bake shop with people, so I just randomly picked out different things I could see. Ordering was quick, but getting what I ordered took a bit. While we waited (maybe 10 minutes) the sweet smell inside was heaven and I liked the open windows showing the bakers working. They have these windows not just inside the bakery, but outside too. When my name was called I went up to pay for my order and saw everything was packaged nicely. This was a great experience and I will most definitely be back! Lobster Tails ($5.95) - Excellent! Try this! It's flaky with a cream inside and a little Bailey's Irish Cream. This was my favorite of what I tried. Eclair ($2.50) - This was cut if half and had a filling. It also had chocolate on top. This was pretty good. I thought at first site that it didn't have enough chocolate on it, but the chocolate was thick and the right amount. Cream Puff ($2.50) - Custard filled with powdered sugar on top. I took a bite and thought it was good, so I told hubby to try it and he finished it. Glad I at least got a bite! Chocolate Cannoli ($3/Mini) - This I figured I would like, but I ended up loving it! The amount of filling was decent. I'd order this one again. Cannoli ($2.50/mini) - The filling has a ricotta cream with chocolate chips. I did like this one a lot and would eat it again, but I personally preferred the chocolate cannoli. Strawberry Tart ($2.85) - This was my least favorite. If you do try this, I would recommend eating it soon. When I got home with my box, the strawberry tart looked like it melted a bit and the strawberry slid off. None of that really bothered me because I hadn't had it before and didn't know it wasn't something that didn't travel well. The way it tasted did bother me though, The bottom was rock hard and I had trouble even biting into it. I might try it again in the future, but am in no rush. Chocolate Fudge Cupcake ($3.50) - I had the option between a vanilla or chocolate cupcake and chose the chocolate. It had a chocolate fudge frosting with sprinkles on top. This was just average. Not bad, but not great. Carrot Cupcake ($3.50) - Of the 2 cupcakes I tried, this was the best. The cupcake was moist and the cream cheese frosting was very good. They also have merchandise for sale (mugs, cookbooks, etc.) and take special orders for cakes and other goodies.",
            "There are many places that you can go to and have the best chocolate cake or have the best in Carrot cake but when you you like something that is very creamy and makes you return for a second time and get a second that is really good and the flavor is the best . There is one thing that many Say is anything you do in Vegas is stays in Vergas but there are so many thing that many people don't know of is there are some really great bakeries that are in the city of Las Vegas and the many restaurants are the best in Dinner .Yes for many if you remember the television series Cake Boss is the one that has created his own restaurants and some of the best baked delicious deserts that have attracted so many across the United States . Yes the many deserts that you see his stores make and the colorful cakes can make one say its a wonderland of fine cakes and deserts and the many deserts are of the New York style deserts . When I had went to Vegas that I wanted to see what Carlos was about the many people and yet the bakery looked like just another bakery and the customers were just the ones that were getting things to take back home to there many states . The many deserts that were at Carlos had to be the great grouping and the many fruity flavors that came out of Carlos Bakery I could tell the staff there had done many cakes and they were getting things ready for more to be put out .The many cakes they have there are the best in town and the many Italian flavors you find the multi colored cakes that have the best fruit flavors , and the grand cakes the carrot cake and the Red Velvet Cakes that have real cream cheese frosting . At the Venetian Hotel you can see the Gondaleirs that steer the long boats that you can take a ride in with your wife or wife to be there are so many that love the Venetian . With Carlos Bakery and the Restaurant that is close by you can the best Italian Dinner that you have ever tasted and still have room for desert . Yes the Venetian is one of the best and with the great place of Carlos you get to sit have great cake or baked good that is pure Italian .",
            "I've always wanted to try his pastries since I've heard so many things about it but I've always been to lazy to try to find it lol. Embarrassed to say this cause I've always stayed at palazzo/Venetian as a visitor to resident. I had to wait in line but they had an efficient system going on so the wait wasn't too bad. Let me just start by saying EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD! Like I wanted to get everything but I knew it was going to be very expensive as no prices were marked, it's like order what looks good then surprise! I ended up getting 2 lobster tails, 2 cannolis, and a strawberry cheesecake. The lobster tails were AMAZING. They were crispy and perfect, even when I ate it around 5 hours after buying them. I liked that they weren't too sweet and even my mom loved them. I am definitely going to buy more of those when I go back. The cannolis on the other hand weren't that good. I ended up only eating half of one and gave the other one away. I was disappointed in them and wish I had ordered more lobster tails instead. The cheesecake was expensive like almost $12 and it was so small. It was pretty good though, there's not much crust or anything like Cheesecake Factory ones but more like just the cheesecake part. If you're a cheesecake fan I definitely recommend. Overall I'd definitely go back for more lobster tails. I'd highly recommend you get some if you stop by! The bakery is pretty pricey but if it's good, it's worth it!",
            "First thing I notice is how small and compact the place is. Area is fairly crowded and it might be a little difficult to navigate through. It might just be because the time of the day, around 6PM. First of all, service is amazing. The people are very nice and easy to talk to. Our order was fairly messed up though (missing items, got items we didnt order), but we're all human, so nothing too big. We posted a picture containing several items (lobster tail, chocolate mousse towers, cannolis, jelly cookie, eclairs, and 7 layered cookies). After trying all the items, I can say, personally, the only one I liked was the Lobster Tail. The cream was very light and fluffy and the outside was amazing. It had a light crunch, while the powdered sugar giving it a little more \"character.\" I would definitely go back for more.(: However, the rest were fairly standard and bland. Two words doesn't do it justice. The jelly cookie tasted like a thicker sugar cookie. If you enjoy sugar cookies, i'm pretty sure you'll love these. Our picture shows a strawberry and watermelon shaped jelly cookie. All i'm saying is, super thick. 7 layered cookies has the texture of an andes mint, mainly due to the thick chocolate on top. It has a small layer of strawberry jam, with the rest tasting like cake. The eclairs were definitely my second favorite from this run. The inside is very jelly donut tasting (yes, poor choice of wording). The main hit is the bread. It's very light and easily compliments the filling. Oh, there's also chocolate on top. The cannoli has a fairly thick and crunchy shell. However, the inside is pretty light and just melts in your mouth. It kind of does break apart easily though. The tiramisu is SUPER light. I'll just leave it at that. You're eating coffee flavored clouds. Lastly, the Chocolate Mousse Tower. Heavy in chocolate and probably needs more strawberry to offset the thickness. It is Mousse, so you shouldn't be surprised. I did it enjoy it, but it gets overwhelming after a couple bites. Overall, interesting place. We had a lot of hype coming in here (my girlfriend has probably watched every episode of Cake Boss. One dream she had was to go to NJ to visit the bakery). I was just a little disappointed and probably won't be back unless its for lobster tails. We ordered a total of 10 different items and only recieved 7 of them. Big name, standard taste. Sorry Also, the organization needs working on. It'd be kind of nice to get everything we ordered.(:",
            "I came here because I am a dessert whore and to see what the hype was about. Yes, it's convenient to rely on others' reviews, but I wanted to experience it personally. What the hell, I was there anyways. Luckily, there was no major line when I walked up. There were so many sweets to choose from. After scanning the display cases, something caught my eye... The Mini Tiramisu!!! There were ladyfingers surrounding the entire tiramisu! Although feeling still a bit skeptical, I knew I was going to regret if I were to walk away from it. After paying, I went up to the room to indulge in this still-questionable delight. As I stuck my fork into it, I was pleasantly surprised. The ladyfingers were uber soft!!! I gingerly but carefully forked all the way down to the bottom of the tiramisu and gave the first bite to my girlfriend. Her big eyes went bug eyes! She promised I will LOVE this tiramisu. After giving my husband a bite, he approved of it also. Now, it was my turn to taste this piece of heaven. OMG it was love at first bite! I started squirming screeching from delight! This was the best tiramisu I've ever had! It was made just the way I like it--very soft ladyfingers and a completely soaked bottom with a not-too-overpowering sweetness all around. I was completely sweetly, madly and deeply hypnotized by this too-good-to-be-true tiramisu. Yes, Buddy surely knows desserts! Now I fully know and acknowledge his amazing creations! It's not just a hype, it's an eye-rolling orgasmic explosion in your mouth! Seconds??? YES PLEASE!!!"

            "What can you ask for in Dairyland? ICE CREAM. I gained like 15 pounds the first year I got to Madison because I couldn't stop eating ice cream. every day. SO DELICIOUS! I love how creamy and rich the ice cream are. And the flavors? rich. and sinful. just like how ice cream should be. What to try: Zanzibar!! Rich dark chocolate, not too bitter, not too sweet. Just right. mm. Fat Elvis! Banana, chocholate chunks and peanut butter. chocolate chunks are not my favorite. but overall. I love peanut butter and banana. woohoo Yippee skippee. peanut butter ice cream with brownie, salted caramel, pretzel! love the combination!!! Heaps of love - everything sinful that you love. chocolate, brownie, caramel nuts etc etc. Btw, if you are crunching for a project or school, they came up with a caffeinated ice cream (BANG!). I haven't had the occasion to try it, but it sounds much better than the 5 hour energy drinks. Feel free to ask to taste the flavors, there are endless choices!! Hint: summer walk down state street, get an ice cream to cool you down!",
            "We came here around 8pm on a cold Saturday evening and there were a surprising number of people here despite it being about 10 degrees outside! I was impressed with the interesting variety of flavors, but after a few minutes looking everything over we got the heaps of love and the honey ginger. The heaps of love was very satisfying and rich, with some nice chunks of cookie dough and swirls of fudge in each bite. The honey ginger was good, too, though a bit meltier in consistency. You could definitely taste the ginger in it. I think it would have been great with the green tea flavor that they also offer. Overall, pretty solid selection of flavors and yummy ice cream.",
            "We purchased 18 gallons of ice cream from the factory for our daughter's wedding - and it did not disappoint! Multiple guests commented on this ice cream being the best! But there is so much more to this company than the ice cream... 1) The groom has an extreme nut allergy and gluten intolerance. Christy was so kind to walk me through the processing of their ice cream and to assure me that there would be no issues. So the groom got his favorite flavor of Birthday Cake! 2) My in-laws blew a tire out on their drive up to Madison, so they could not make the designated 11 a.m. pick-up. They sat in a tire shop most of the day waiting for a new tire. The team at the factory store was super nice to let them know that they would wait for them! Thankfully, my in-laws arrived at the store right at 4:00 pm - closing time! 3) Buying the ice cream in bulk was such a better deal than trying to buy from C***S**** - and the quality is so much better! I will forever be a fan of the Chocolate Shoppe - this company is doing so much more than just selling awesome ice cream! Thank you!!!",
            "5 stars Best ice cream everrrr!!! I am a huge ice cream fan and have tried ice cream from north east to mid west! And I would say this is by far the best best best ice cream I have had! I tried strawberry cheesecake, blueberry cheesecake, chocolate, flavors in both shake and ice cream scoop and \"I LoVeeD it!\". I always get extra thick ice cream shake and I eat half and freeze half to have it later!! And Oh my wat a delicious goodness the shake becomes next day after freezing!! Both blueberry and strawberry cheesecake ice creams have nice generous chunks of cheesecake in it. And the cheesecake tastes so fresh and creamy!! The ice cream itself is so rich in texture, creamy and perfect!! In past with other ice cream shops whenever I used to take shakes it always comes out having icy crystals in it which made the entire experience boring. But this place serves best creamy mouth watering shakes with no ice crystals!!! I am yet to try more flavors from this shop and will update my review soon with more pictures!! Inside - There are 5-6 tables inside to sit and eat the ice cream. I did see dirty floors with ice cream goo on it, so I would hope they clean it when someone drops ice cream on the floor. Parking - You will have to find a parking in the nearby area as they don't have their own parking area but it's no hassle as there is ample amount of empty parking spots available in the area even on Friday evenings! Ambiance- Nice place, great service, you can taste the ice cream before making a decision! Every time I go there I see the place packed with university students, which I love coz it reminds me of my college days!! Hehe Can't way to go there again!! Must try this place!! Highly recommend!!",
            "Mmmm, very good ice cream! Since there's no way to get Graeter's in WI (unless I ship it, but I'd end up spending a fortune with how often I'd love to eat it...and it's so much better at the scoop shop), this is a pretty good substitute. I particularly love the great selection of flavors - it seems like there is just about anything and everything you could be in the mood for. Espresso Oreo? Yup. Strawberry Cheesecake? Sure thing. Zanzimint? You got it. Banana or Malted Milk or Peppermint Stick or Cappuccino or Fat Elvis..... I could go on for a while.... As was previously mentioned there's also quite a selection of non-ice cream: gelato, sherbert, non-fat yogurt, soy, etc."

            "Delicious ! Did I say delicious? I came to this place for the first time in 2015 of July. I didn't ever write a review. I haven't come back since July but this place never disappoints. Now that I live in the area, we will be frequent customers! Are you having a craving for sweets? Want delicious ice cream? This is the spot! I'm not much of a sweet tooth person ...but once in a blue moon I get this insatiable craving for sweets! This past weekend was one of them! An ohh my gosh it was so delicious! I felt like the Cookie Monster while i was eating and of course a little guilty aft wards! Believe it's worth breaking the diet every now and then for this place just do extra laps or longer gym session . So my favorite here so far are the ice cream sandwiches ! Homemade cookies with great ice cream. There are usually a great variety of cookies! Cookies I've tried with the sandwiches were: coconut macaroon, snicker doodle (my favorite ) and peanut butter (on this visit). Ice cream i have put in my sandwiches include: pumpkin, butter pecan (one of my faves ! Can't go wrong with this one), and their goat cheese honey pistachio ( also a favorite of mine and a seasonal one! I've been having a thing for goat ice cream since I've tried it in Seattle ). So the cool thing is you can mix and match anything. You don't have to have the same to cookies and choose whatever ice cream you want! Other things I've tried here, is their freezes! Very good! Similar to a blizzard but a 100 times better! Salted caramel freeze is the one my boyfriend had and I had a taste and it was yummy! The place itself is cute! Old fashioned style looking decor and lots of candy to choose from. Customer service is wonderful ! I hear there are lines here constantly but I have happened to miss the lines every time ! I definitely recommend the place! You will be happy you tried it !",
            "Sweet Pea and I decided on one recent night to rail down to Churn and see what all of the fuss was about. We'd heard a lot about it and its restaurant counterpart, Windsor. Bottom line, it was good ice cream. It was not swoon-worthy. I will not be getting in my car making a mad late night ice cream run just to get Churn ice cream. But, although I am definitely an ice cream person, I couldn't really imagine myself doing that for any particular place's ice cream. We had no crystallization issues like other reviewers mentioned- the texture was good, heavy, creamy. I tried the Madagascar vanilla, which was rich and vanilla-y as you'd expect, but I ended up ordering the coconut, in a cup, with the salted caramel topping. Both the ice cream and the topping were good. The one thing I will say about the salted caramel (and I REALLY like salted caramel) was that it was overpowering in terms of flavor. Next time I'd probably just get it with the vanilla. Or maybe chocolate if I felt frisky. And I really want to try that pretzel cone thing they have there, man that looked awesome. Sweet Pea tried the bubble gum and ended up with the blackberry with salted caramel (yeah...\"interesting\" choice there Sweet Pea) and had the same impressions pretty much that I did. It was good. He did keep saying over and over again that the bubble gum flavor was delightful and that next time he was going to order it. I will say that the reviewer that commented in the vast disparity between scoop sizes was right on. Sweet Pea's was 1.5 to 2 times larger than mine. The atmosphere is cute. Sweet Pea did not like the layout, because the place gets quite busy, and there is no organized line nor even a really good area for everyone to stand in. It's pretty narrow and people get bunched up. On (kind of) an aside: is it me, or are these hipster places becoming interchangeable? It feels kinda beautiful, but soulless. I'm ready for the next thing.",
            "I have been lucky to not hit a line every time I've come here, it always start building out the door after I've ordered. Their flavors are so delicious and their staff is always so friendly! Only thing is that it is always sooooo cold inside, but perfect for when it's hot out! It's located in a very hip, very upcoming area and I love coming here. The ambiance and d\u00c3\u00a9cor of this place is like an old-style candy store - it's so cute! Not only do they sell ice cream and such, they also sell candies. Must try flavors are Guiness (must be 21+ to order, or even try), all of their holiday flavors are fantastic and spot on, Vietnamese Coffee (yummm). For sundaes I've tried the Strawberry Shortcake that was pretty true to taste. For Lil' Freezies I've tried the Salted Caramel which was delicious and actually had a good mixture of salty versus sweet flavors. Peanut Butter Cup is a must for peanut butter lovers! I would recommend getting one of their ice creams served on a cone; all of their cones are so good. Definitely one of my upcoming favorite ice cream spots!",
            "Ok, I love ice cream. Yes, but not all ice cream is created equal. Having grown up with the crappy ice milk you get at certain locations that shall remain nameless, but use two letters as their name, you develop certain flawed expectations of what is good ice cream. Then the $6 tiny cup of average crap with a mix in named after the cold rock they mix your stuff on. Yes, you remember with nostalgia the hand cranked ice cream at grandma's house, as long as you were young enough to not have to take a turn, and getting to lick the paddle, but as soon as you were old enough you realized what an absolute pain in the nether regions that was and how grandpa and dad always fought against it, since its not 1885 anymore. So, when you get a little bit of nostalgia with really good ice cream that you got to buy, not recreating a turn of the century sweatshop for fun, and see candy from your childhood for sale, you jump on it right! RIGHT! So the wife and I hit churn on our stay-cation away from the kids last year, and it was amazing! Madagascar vanilla, orangecicle ice cream and the secret ingredient, a delicious apricot cranberry oatmeal cookie. HA HA HA HA, it was so good, not too sweet with tons of flavor! Wife got some combination of death by chocolate that she loved and i hardly paid attention to because mine was so good. I manage on most days to avoid driving over unless i am really stressed. I swear my therapist must be a part owner of the place. The sweets shop nature of the place with the nice shaded patio in back really is quite fun, and they also sell some jars of cool syrups and such. If you like ice cream, go and have fun, but heaven help you if you take the last apricot cranberry oatmeal cookie before I get there, some things cannot be overlooked.",
            "What a small space! I've wanted to visit since Churn first opened, and that was five years ago. I've noticed friends check in for all of this time, and I've seen their posted photos, and yet, I never expected this shop to be in this tiny space. I liked how the shop looked from the outside. It was 118 degrees F today, and I found a great end spot, next to a tree (?), and the shop looked really quaint in the shade. Opened the door of the shop, and bam! There were so many customers sardined in an 10 foot x 5 foot of space (guess-timate) in front of the ice cream display case. On the other side of the case were three employees, two of which were cheerfully greeting customers and offering up samples, while the other looked like she'd had enough and wanted out. She'd just washed her hands, dried them with a paper towel, and unknowingly overshot the trash can right behind her. Thankfully, she hit the target emptying a milkshake receptacle... Ah, well. I don't blame her, as who wouldn't dislike it if everyone kept opening the door to let the oppressive heat in? I noticed about 9 flavors, five of which were limited-time only (a few of which were sorbets). I asked to sample the Toasted Coconut, Vietnamese Coffee, and Peaches 'n Honey ice cream, and the Blueberry-Lemon sorbet, the latter two were LTOs. I enjoyed all four, but did find the sorbet to be a little too sweet. I normally get one, or two flavors at a time, but since I don't know when I'll be in the neighborhood again, I went for the other three. My favorite was, surprise, the coffee, followed by the coconut. I wished I could've fancied the peach more, but I found it too tart in comparison with the other two. I'd most likely order it again, possibly on a waffle cone to give it a bit more sweetness and texture (and I'm all for texture when eating ice cream!). <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/churn-phoenix-3?select=Vw4YKVsjoUQw-mJKBNcctw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/chur\u20ac\u00a6</a> The flavors and textures were very enjoyable, but I found the colors of the peach and the coconut, which looked similar, a little strange. I'm hoping it to mean that Churn does not use artificial coloring in their recipes. The coffee, however, had these gorgeous coffee bean flecks, so it was a shame that the full scoop was hidden at the bottom of the cup. I know now to order my favorite flavor last, so that it will be on top! Oh, and yes, you may order half-scoops. I originally ordered the coffee and the peach, which prompted the bubbly young man to ask \"Would you like a full-scoop each, or half a scoop?\" I asked what the price difference was, and he said \"A dollar,\" so I went with two full scoops. I then decided to add the coconut, and asked for the peach and coconut as half-scoops. Next time, I'll order only one scoop of one flavor, as I ended up throwing away half of the peach and half of the coconut, anyway. (To save calories! Also, I was quite full with the coffee ice cream and halfsies of the two apps and entree from my visit to Okra previously.) What's with the cheap, nostalgic candy all over the place? Better to get rid of them, or move them to higher shelves, and use the extra space for a standing bar/table area. Since there wasn't much space in the shop to stand around in, and the misted patio** was crowded, I decided to hang out at the hall between Windsor and Churn and have a look at the wall decorated with analog tapes. Now that's nostalgia I can appreciate! **Those misters do not spray plain water! I was told elsewhere that they spray a solution blend to help prevent clogs (from lime buildup?). It's the reason I try not to park next to misters, and a reason why I don't want those misters spraying into my food and drink!"

            "Churn is a really nice addition to the businesses on east carson street. They have pastries, coffee, ice cream and Gelato. They probably have more products but I was looking for some good ice cream. I settled on a small cup of coffee with sprinkles. It was a nice scoop. The ice cream was rich and tasty. I also sampled a friend's girl scout thin mint ice cream. It was a winner too. The store is bright and clean. Everything seems to be clearly marked to help the new clientele. Give the place a try.",
            "Super cool ice cream shop on an easily accessible corner on Carson St in Southside. Lots of flavors to choose from, ice cream is thick and creamy, similar to Dave and Andy's, and there's a lot of seating space inside to enjoy your ice cream or pastries. Definitely love the open space inside, staff is friendly and approachable. I love that you can get multiple different flavors in a pint. A great welcomed and appreciated addition to southside!",
            "FINALLY! Churn has come south of the city! I've yearned for years to have them here, and she did not disappoint!!! What a fantastic build/atmosphere! I personally go for the ice cream, which is one of the very best in the tri-county area. The taste, texture, and consistency gets an A+; the amazing flavors and presentation gets extra credit. The prices are fair and average compared to other quality shops, so expect to pay a bit more if you're used to lesser quality. They also specialize in coffees/drinks. Really, anything you'd want, they have it. You can even have best of both worlds and get espresso over a scoop of ice cream! Finally, they offer a bunch of cafe-like foods, such as scones, muffins, bagels, cookies, etc. As for the service? I think it's fantastic. You go to any of their locations, and they're all so pleasant. (Maybe if you're miserable to them, they're not as friendly. I wouldn't know though, because that's just not me). They even put their enthusiasm into their social media posts, making them the very best with that, in my opinion. All around wonderful place to go, and now that they're not 1hr+ away from me, I will be a frequent customer!!!",
            "We checked out Churn on their grand opening and were pleasantly surprised by the number of delicious options available. From coffee, to lattes, to milkshakes and arctic swirls, and homemade scoops and cones, there's something here for everyone. We both enjoyed our lattes, and the menu of available flavors is quite lengthy! We also tried the S'mores ice cream, which was a perfectly soft and light consistency, almost like a gelato, and had chunks of graham cracker and chunks of chocolate. You can sample any flavor, so you can't go wrong! We'll definitely be back, and often!",
            "We went on a Friday night, it was busy, but we didn't have to wait long! Everyone was very friendly. My boyfriend got the Oreo hot fudge milkshake and loved it! I got a vanilla cream soda float with Oreo ice cream. I didn't love the vanilla soda, tasted a little bit artificial, but the ice cream was amazing! We will definitely be back here :)"

            "I have heard amazing things about this place and I had my order already in my head before I even walked into the market. I was going to order a sweet crepe with marscapone and apples and caramel. It was going to be amazing I just knew it. But then we went very early in the morning and since I have been trying to be a better eater (yeah I know, I know, West Side Market is NOT the place to give up eating sweets ha ha ha) Anyway I was very good and even offered to share one with my husband. He agreed to and we opted for the Complete. It has egg, ham and Gruyere cheese. It is simple and savory and i found it as amazing as everyone had said they would be. What I really was surprised by was how filling it was. My husband - who is a big eater and myself both were full after eating it. And for only $6. My day of eating fun new things was under way with a huge gold star! The only reason I did not give them 5 stars was because they did not offer any napkins and the paper cone type holder leaks -- and I ended up with grease on one of my favorite blouses. That kinda sucked having a spot on my shirt for the rest of the day but next time I'll know to be extra careful and make sure I grab napkins because there is certainly no way I cannot stop here again! Next time Sweet crepe...next time!",
            "I was shocked when I came here to write a review and saw all of the negativity surrounding the customer service. I had a very different experience! Yes the line was long. Yes there was some confusion as to whether people were in line for coffee or crepes. But that aside, the crepe I ordered was delicious and the gentleman working the counter was quite pleasant! After some deliberation (because let's face it, everything they serve looks amazing), I ordered their special \"Sweet Crepe\" not usually on the menu, containing lemon ch\u00c3\u00a8vre, strawberries, and honey. I was not disappointed! The crepe came out toasty and delicious, with the sweet cheese melting into every little crepe crevice. And coming from Columbus where crepes like this usually cost a pretty penny, I thought $5 was a steal. The line was a little long, but I did come on a Saturday. Expect to wait around 30 minutes; the crepes are worth it though!",
            "Crepes de Luxe consistently knocks it out of the park. To me the savory crepes taste just like the ones of Paris food carts. The line is ridiculously divided yes - however I get the wait time is because each is cooked fresh. Now as for the \"rudeness\" really I think it's just to keep the line moving! I mean think about it if you are talking on ur phone during the wait fine but at the top of the counter, at Mecca, IN the end zone just order - you aren't supposed to make the chef your new best friend! Honestly the King, the lemon, the dark chocolate strawberry or the Nutella & banana are all fabulous. Savory wise I've only had one and it was ok just not as good as the sweets to me. I start every market day waiting in this line - I know they are worth it -- and to me that's all that matters.",
            "Wow--I didn't realize how poorly people thought of the service at this place. We came Sunday around 1pm for lunch and miraculously had no line ahead of us (one soon formed behind us). There was only one person managing the crepe stand and impressively juggled three crepe stations in addition to taking orders and payment (changing gloves each time he did so)--despite the business, he was polite, confirming our orders with us before he made them and acknowledged our thanks as we received our orders. We shared a Florence (spinach, egg and Gruyere) and Citron creme (house-made lemon curd, honey mascarpone)--both were perfect! The savory crepes are made with a heartier buckwheat flour, but both were thin but with a chewy integrity, warm and with crisp edges all around. -Florence: spinach cooked just enough which paired well with the melty Gruyere -Citron creme: the lemon curd was perfectly tangy balanced by the rich mascarpone This place most definitely makes the best crepes I've ever had and I'll be back! Even if the service is as atrocious as people claim",
            "Finally bit the bullet and got in line for the crepes. I've been to the market countless times and always pass it by because I don't want to wait in line (same for the gyros). I purposely didn't check the time because I didn't want to know how long it would take, but the line moved pretty slowly. All I could think the whole time was how much the coffee place next door must hate them because I heard so many people say \"wow look at the line for coffee!\" and keep walking, which I myself did several times before I realized the line was for crepes only. I don't know if the crepe people have much control over the layout of their stand, but I would think they should consider swapping where the prep area and cook areas are if they can. It would make ordering a lot easier, and probably faster since the guy taking orders wouldn't be shouting over 10 people \"who's next? what did you say?!\" repeatedly, because as it's currently set up he's trying to take orders while standing about as far away as possible from the person who is next up to give their order. Anyway, the crepes themselves were really good, and I enjoyed watching them make them. They were a good value for $6-7. I got the Florence for myself (spinach, egg, gruyere), and a peanut butter and banana for my son. I ended up eating most of his, and actually liked it better than my own. Without a line, I'd definitely be back. With the line, probably not."

            "I can't tell you if this is the best ice cream in Madison but I can tell you I'm totally happy that I tried it. If I lived in Madison, I'd easily go here all the time. I decided to go with the Alumni Park After Dark Chocolate. It obviously wasn't dark because it was in the middle of the day but I couldn't pass up dark chocolate ice cream. It was dark chocolate ice cream with white chocolate chips. You should know that the white chocolate chips were more like shavings than chips! I IMMEDIATELY FELL IN LOVE! It was also supposed to have caramel. I didn't taste the caramel in my scoop but it was certainly gooey. I decided on a waffle cone. It was a small mistake because there was a hole in the bottom. It made things messy. It is true what they say; The messier the dish, the better but when I eat ice cream... the last thing I want to be is all sticky. This place is like most shops. Pick your cone or bowl. Choose your size. Pick your flavors. They have some typical flavors like vanilla, cookies and cream, and mint chocolate chip. They also have other flavors. All of them sound delicious! I want to go back to try their orange custard chocolate chip! If you're near this place and need a refreshing treat, go here. After you get your ice cream, there are also plenty of places to walk around outside. There were hordes of people the day I was there. Ok... maybe not hordes but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to use hordes in a review.",
            "BLUE MOON ICE CREAM!! I'm sorry. Let me rewind just a moment. We had spent the morning and early afternoon around State Street, campus and the Capitol area. After visiting two free art museums, eating some sushi, and walking up and down State Street in the hot, hot heat...we were easily talked in to stopping for some ice cream. The Daily Scoop is in the Union building, and prices are very reasonable. I got to try my friend's orange chocolate chip and it tasted JUST like the Christmas candy! But when I looked at the menu of the available flavors and I saw BLUE MOON....well, I was over the moon! My mouth watered and I was filled with a joyous rush of nostalgia! Blue Moon was my absolute favorite ice cream flavor growing up. I have not encountered it outside of Wisconsin (although, to be honest, I don't eat a great deal of ice cream any more....). I don't know what it is...apparently the flavor is actually vanilla and orange together, but colored blue. And I don't know how the color might affect the taste, but it doesn't just taste like a creamy orange....it just tastes wonderful! I was only going to to get a single scoop in a dish. But when it comes to Blue Moon ice cream....I am pretty proud of myself for stopping myself at two scoops. A little less willpower and I might have eaten the entire tub in their freezer! Once you get your sweet treat, you can take it outside to enjoy the view of and breeze from the lake. People watch and eat your ice cream as it melts. It was a great way to end the afternoon. Certainly worth a visit!",
            "After dinner on the terrace, we were looking to get some Babcock ice cream. Unfortunately, the outdoor ice cream Babcock stand was closed at 9pm, so we had just missed it. Thankfully, the guy closing up shop said there was more Babcock ice cream inside the union at Daily Scoop. The line is ridiculous. It is about a 15 minute wait. Is it worth it? The little 5 year old girl in front of me would say so. Her parents tried every ounce of logic to convince her to get ice cream elsewhere, but when they asked if she still wanted ice cream from here, it was a resounding \"YES!\" In my opinion, I don't like the fluffiness of the Babcock ice cream compared to some of the denser and harder ice cream in Atlanta, so I was thinking this deserves more of a 3.5 star. However, they do have some fun flavors, so I'll round it up to a 4 star. BLUE MOON This is a deceivingly named ice cream, because it is not related to the Blue Moon craft beer at all. Instead, it is a fruit flavored ice cream that straight up tastes like a ice cream version of Fruit Loops. I tried a sample of it, and it definitely is very unique, and would see how kids would love this flavor and the blue coloring. However, please don't order it thinking it is craft beer ice cream. CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE DOUGH This flavor was mostly a vanilla cream based ice cream with a bunch of chocolate chips, and unfortunately not any noticeable cookie dough chunks. Because of the lack of cookie dough chunks, I wasn't a fan of this. ORANGE CUSTARD CHOCOLATE CHIP This was superb! It reminded me of my elementary school days with a hint of the orange cream Flintstone pops with a bunch of decent sized chocolate chip pieces. It was worth the purchase. MOCHA MACCHIATO This was my favorite of all the flavors I tried. The coffee flavor added just the perfect amount of bitterness to offset the sweetness of the ice cream. My general disappointment with the rest of the ice cream was that it was too sweet and fluffy for my liking and wish I had something to wash it down. The Mocha Macchiato was the perfect balance of flavor. Waffle cone? Yes. Get it.",
            "Cool place to grab some ice cream at the Memorial Union Terrace. Decent size lines even on weekdays. Decided to get the mint, chocolate oreo ice cream. Love this flavor- chocolate chips can get boring sometimes but the oreo mix clashes my two favorite ice cream flavors together: cookies and cream and mint chip. The free cake cone is also a fun addition especially when you reach the end of your treat and the ice cream has softened up the cake cone. It's a great, refreshing snack as you enjoy the view from the Terrace. There's ample sitting outside but if you want that A/C life then don't worry because there's an ample amount of those seats too. Or you can grab the ice cream and take a stroll around the UW campus- beautiful campus with unique architecture.",
            "Fun affordable place to take family or friends while walking around campus. Sitting in lakefront cafe area overlooking lake or walking on lakeshore is perfect for enjoying the yummy ice cream. Orange custard choc chip a unique flavor and the berry good parents was surprisingly good. Plus its always nice to support the local university and food science dept. The blue flavor that tastes like fruit loops was fun to taste too The ice cream is throwback americana style (not expensive gourmet or organic), kids will love it and the family too."

            "Hype little ice cream spot. Definitely a vibe, throwback cereal interior gives you that nostalgia. My friend got the bowl, Cosmo & Wanda--fruit loops and captain crunch all berries with almond milk and ice cream haha, she loaded up, that was actually legit though because the almond milk almost made it sweeter if you can imagine that. Perfect Combo I went with a shake and got Mucha Lucha it was the perfect little mix basically a hella sweet horchata milkshake, perfect cinnamon sugar balance. We both enjoyed it so much. They were very considerate when helping move the line as quick as they could, paying attention to detail. I think we had to switch something last minute but they were great with communicating to us and quick to make fixes and pivot. They were definitely using gloves and all that so it felt very clean and just well run. Lots of great smiles from the staff and we loved that, we felt very comfortable and happy to be there.",
            "This place is SO fun and amazing! Came here after looking up dessert places in the area, and I bookmarked this place because it sounded super unique. Also, we all know that the best part of cereal is the milk at the end, right? When you walk into the shop, you are greeted by the fun cereal boxes along the wall/shelves and the neon lights. The menu has a lot of unique offerings in addition to the ability to create your own mix. You can also opt for a milkshake or cereal in a bowl. I always opted for the milkshake, and I personally think that is the way to go. I was able to try the cosmo and Wanda, Scooby snacks, and mucha lucha. My favorite was Cosmo and Wanda because I love fruit loops and captain crunch berries. This place makes you feel young and alive. It brings back good memories of childhood. I am so happy this place exists and is able to bring joy into the community!",
            "The service was slow but SUPER friendly which made this place worth waiting in line for. They had a place (now closed down) just like this in London and when I went to the London, it was amazing... such a simple concept but so delicious. Unfortunately my husband wanted one of the bowls but they were out of them so we can settled for shakes. They were still good! I would definitely recommend this place.

            "Charlotte we did it! We got a deliciously creative & nostalgic foodie spot straight from LA! Located in Brevard Court in Uptown, AKA the French Quarter, just across the street from Romare Bearden Park and so worth the hassle of finding parking. Luckily, I was able to walk over and avoid the parking bit. I have been overly excited to try Day & Night since I heard what the concept was. A restaurant that sells cereal? Weird, but heck yes, let's try it! I wasn't disappointed at all. I ordered the cookies and cream bowl. It had two of my fav childhood cereals: Cookie Crisps and Hershey's cookies and cream, almond milk, whipped cream and chocolate syrup. How come I wasn't already making THIS bowl as a kid?! It was pure heaven in my mouth. I'll definitely be back soon to try ALL of the other bowls! My one cool date recommendation is to pack a picnic, get setup in Romare, then walk over to Day & Night for your sweet dessert after a nice picnic. I have a feeling this place will be extremely popular! Especially in the coming summer months. Check it out to get your nostalgic fix and your sugar fix! Can't wait to go back.",
            "amazing impression as soon as you walk in. i was greeted by a funny, out going, and friendly young man and he explained how everything worked. he helped me choose the right shake and he whipped it up in no time. meanwhile he put on some good ol cartoons while we waited. the vibe and atmosphere inside was great with neon lights and different cereals ive never seen before posted all over the room. i got the strawberry shortcake shake and it was one of the best desserts ive ever had. super innovative and original idea with a very friendly face to provide it. it is also a black owned business which i am very happy to support. overall it was an amazing experience!"

            "Great donuts and great service- a definite win in my book! I read an article that this spot would be opening in the same location as a former donut shop. On Sunday I was finally downtown doing one of my make my own food crawls and knew I needed to stop in. We were warmly greeted right away by the employees and the delicious looking donuts. :) Since we were doing a food crawl we narrowed to two donuts, but we were offered some free donuts and who can pass on free donuts? I'm glad that I was able to try several flavors and get a good idea of what they offer. The apple donut was my favorite. It had a nice spice cake flavor with small chunks of apple in the cake and a nice glaze on top. The chai donut was unique and also hit the spot. The birthday cake donut had Oreo in the center and was tasty as well. The vanilla was my friend's favorite and while simple, I loved this one as well. The chocolate fritter was less moist than the other donuts and had a nice flavor, but wasn't my favorite of the bunch. Overall, nice texture and awesome flavor for the donuts. We also enjoyed some of the delicious Stumptown coffee. Stumptown is always delicious and quality coffee is always good with a donut. I also tried the Nitro brew which was bold and perfect with the sweet donuts. The employees were very friendly and generous in making sure we were able to try as much as possible during our visit. I love visiting a local business where I can feel the pride in the business. It's cool to have another business join what is becoming a pretty cool downtown Las Vegas.",
            "We used to go to this other donut place close to our house, but have stopped patronizing them because of their rude costumer service. Last Mother's Day, my hubby asked me where I wanted to go, and since I have been craving donuts and had the donut bar bookmarked for a while, I asked to go here. It was quite a bit of a drive considering we live in southwest, but we decided to go anyway. We got here around 12:30-1ish, and they only had a few selections left. Don't know if it was because it was Mother's Day, but the lady behind the counter informed us that because of the limited selection, we could get a box for $10 and fill it with as much donuts as we could fit. Although the creme br\u00c3\u00bbl\u00c3\u00a9e donut was sold out and it was slim pickins, we were still able to get a decent amount of very yummy donuts. What would normally be a donut worth $3 a pop, we were able to get a full box for only $10! My favorite amongst our choices was the caramel latte donut. I thought it would have been too sweet, but it was actually just the right amount of sugar. Another favorite was the espresso donut, even though I'm not a big fan of the cake kind. We brought the box back to my in-laws house, and everyone was raving about the donuts. Fast forward to today-- My husband, son, and I had a hankering for donuts and braved the early Sunday morning drive to downtown. We got to the donut bar just a couple minutes shy of 8am and there was already a long line outside the door, waiting for the store to open. When 8am rolled around, the chef (?) opened the door and gleefully greeted the people waiting in line, and then proceeded to usher everyone in. We could smell the freshly made donuts before even stepping foot inside the store, which only fueled our hunger more. Upon stepping inside, it was such a different experience from when we went during Mother's Day. The cases were full of different flavored donuts, both fried and cake donuts alike. I truly felt like a kid in a candy store! The girl behind the counter offered our son a free inside-out themed donut, which I thought was really thoughtful-- they really cater to their customers at this place! Anyways, it was so hard for me to order since I wanted to try everything!!!! But we settled on the French toast donut (which was made to order ), a creme br\u00c3\u00bbl\u00c3\u00a9e donut (obviously a crowd favorite), a Samoa, and a chocolate euphoria for my son. The French toast donut was good, different, and well worth a try. The cup of stumptown coffee they serve there went great with the donut. The Samoa was pretty good but, as I'm not a big fan of cake donut (my hubby is), I think I can pass on that next time. My son enjoyed his chocolate euphoria, and started picking on the chocolate shavings as soon as the donut arrived. Last but not the least, the star among the donuts we chose, the creme br\u00c3\u00bbl\u00c3\u00a9e donut. It was quite small, but for only 2 bucks, it was a steal! My hubby did say that the caramelized sugar on top was a bit thick, but we both agreed that the donut was great and surprisingly not as sweet as we thought it would be. The creme br\u00c3\u00bbl\u00c3\u00a9e filling was smooth and velvety, just how it should be, and accompanied the donut very well. I would honestly come back here just for another one of that donut, but I would be lying if I didn't say I want to try more. I might just have to make it mandatory that we go here every Sunday so we could try out a different donut each time. The strawberry shortcake donut they had looked mighty good, as well as the s'mores donut... I'm drooling just thinking about it XD Although there are plenty other donut shops close to our house, the drive to downtown just to go to donut bar is well worth it. Not only are their donuts great, but all the associates we've had the chance to encounter were all so sweet, helpful, and personable. No wonder people keep flocking this place. Customer service is obviously a priority on their list, and there is nothing better than that... Aside from the donuts, of course lol. Donut bar, you have just gained new loyal customers who will try to frequent your place every Sunday :)",
            "On every stage is a moment for you to shine, as you glow pass along that love and passion for someone else to cherish and celebrate. If your ever in old town, down town Las Vegas stop in for a donut and some coffee. What goes better than these two phrases coffee and donuts? Great I'm glad that your paying attention. Now this ordinary shop might seem dilapidated because it's \"downtown,\" but just walk through the door and enjoy the beauty. Now make sure and get here before around noon time because when the donuts are done; so are the staff for the day. Could you contemplating waiting for the perfect donut for another day. Perhaps not, so forget not having that conversation and get here early. As you walk in the store it's usual standing room only. It's the post pandemic now, so their are no longer any mask restrictions or standing six feet apart. No longer are there rules for how many to can in the store at one time too. Make sure not to push and shove, await your turn for that perfect moment when you get to pick your favorite donuts. Tap your foot or look up at the menu, the moments tick down till it's your turn to have donuts. Can you feel the urge building inside of you? It's almost go time, all those in front of you have been taken care of. Being GO time. You clam up and don't know what you want. Let's calm down and pick one of everything please, as you drool over the glass! You will have no trouble picking out what you want. My favorite is the maple bar with \"real bacon,\" on top. The friendly staff will waste no time making sure you are happy with your donuts decisions. It was national donut day, yes we need a day to come together and share circular moments among those in our lives. Mark the calendar for next year or be the life of the party and just bring a dozen in to everyone. Donuts please, yes. The donuts here are far beyond a donut. The creative charm and joy that makes them possible is exceptional. As you stare through the glass such choices; once you try one you will be back for the one that you did not try. Let your inhibitions go. Coffee and donuts all in the same place. Happy is here until they lock the doors. Get here early to enjoy the best selections of the day before they are gone. It's always happy even if you have to wait in line. Explore there menu options on your phone. As the line dwindles down it's getting closer to your turn be ready! Oh you were not ready! Did you just get stumped up because of the bombardment of choices. Deep breaths! Now that your on your way to making the day a little more fun and special. Sip your coffee, eat that spectacular donut and make a donut moment.",
            "Donut Kill My Vibe!! This is a cute, small and fun donut bar! It's been in my bookmarked list for the next time I came to Vegas, and I finally got to try them. When you walk in the aroma of fresh donuts hits you in the face. It's also super cute and colorful. I love that you could see all the donuts on display as well as the colors of the place. It's very warm and welcoming. The staff is also extremely nice and patient. I say patient because I was so eager to get inside and take pictures and create a video. Haha. However as far as taste, their donuts are pretty average. They have tons of donuts to choose from but we ended up getting the Big Poppa Tart Donut, Strawberry Filled Donut, and they gave us a free candy cane donut because we had our 14 month old daughter with us. How cool is that?! Very nice and thoughtful. I have never had a donut place offer a free kids donut. However, I will say their donuts are a little more on the expensive side, but most are bigger than your average donut so it balances out. The Big Poppa Tart was definitely big and enough to share. I got the Strawberry one. It's made to look like an oversized Pop-tart. The cool thing is, there is an entire pop tart on the inside of the Big Poppa Tart. The donut itself was very good and tender. It also tasted amazing with the strawberry jam on top. Now I will be honest and say I didn't care much for the Pop-tart on the inside. It was chewy and a little stale tasting as far as texture. It didn't taste like a regular Pop-Tart. I guess something changes as the donut is heated and fried. Overall, the Big Poppa Tart is pretty and the edges taste really good. My husband ate my entire half of my Big Poppa and he never said a thing about the Pop-Tart so I guess it didn't bother him. He just said he couldn't taste it. *Shrugs* I guess it's more of a personal preference. The Strawberry Filled tasted pretty good. I didn't get to taste it because my husband killed it but overall it was good he said. He said it honestly didn't taste like anything special or different than any other Strawberry Filled Donut he has had. I will say this is one of their smaller donuts. If you order a circular shaped donut then these are the bigger ones. I also didn't taste my daughter's donut but my husband did. He said it tasted like a regular donut. I guess she liked it because she ate it all. It was just a donut in the shape of a candy cane with white and red glaze on top. Overall, Donut Bar was cute and fun! As far as taste, I don't think they were anything special. They were pretty average. I will say their creativity of their donuts and some of the flavors is unique but other than that they taste just like any other donut shop.",
            "So 200 plus reviews later not sure anything else can add.....but here we go anyway. I am just about positive am the last yelper that I know in Vegas that finally checked out Donut Bar. I noticed recently Donut Bar has started to open maybe once month or random times at night. So was like NICE finally get to try the pop tart and the creme br\u00c3\u00bbl\u00c3\u00a9e. All the videos seen of the creme br\u00c3\u00bbl\u00c3\u00a9e and one of the stables pop tart looked delicious. I do love my donuts from time to time. I heard that generally there a line when first open and the earlier get here the better. The later you come not really the best idea cause they make only so much donuts everyday and by the end slim pickings (truth nothing worst then stale donut). I got down little earlier because not sure where the place was and parking downtown flat out sucks. Honest if you park near Donut Bar they have self pay parking meters. If ur lucky depending time of day its SUPER easy and cost is cheaper then paying any hotel or parking structure. Dollar on the meter gives you hour. More then enough time (maybe if the line is long then that another story). I was surprise but the line was not that bad only four people ahead of me. Just the fact there was LINE for donut shop still blows my mind. Donut Bar does carry strong name brand. Chef Jeff is not only a passionate owner. The guy knows his donuts and all positive vibes. The minute he open the door greeting all five or six of us come on in. Friendly, all smiles, and love the atmosphere. The smell was awesome minute walked in!!! Fresh batch of donuts, the display case truly gives the donuts even more eye candy, the diversity crazy (oversize homer donut, rectangle pop tart, small circle creme br\u00c3\u00bbl\u00c3\u00a9e, traditional size ones but nothing traditional with the flavors or colors, and untraditional ones with donut cones fill with ice cream or strawberry split), and it long line of donut goodies. You might forget the selection at the top of the line. The place is small so gets filled up fast if want sit down. It located literally next to Carson Kitchen or look for the famous Donut Bar sign outside. The stumpton cold crew deserves shout out. I never had that brand before. I decided try the coconut flavor cold brew in carton. It was perfect compliment go with the donuts. They have other flavors. I believe one was chocolate and the other not sure. They also offer it on tap if you like. The donuts the pop tart is HUGE. If one person can eat one that pretty good. The way pop tart melting into the donut not sure if tasted any of the crust associate with pop tart. The filling you know if fan of pop tart is true and true. The icing and the goodies on top just pushed it sugar overload. I loved it. The creme br\u00c3\u00bbl\u00c3\u00a9e was good. I think that one better eat it on the spot cause the longer it sits the crack on top break it apart. Rock solid. I had fill out my box was got strawberry split. The strawberries was fresh, juicy, and I keep thinking strawberry shortcake."

            "Holy moly I was blown away haha. This place is hard to find and is totally a hole in the wall, you'd have no idea there's an amazing ice cream shop in there. I am a big fan of cute ice cream shops and sometimes I find ice cream places either are adorable and the ice cream is just ok, or ok atmosphere but great ice cream. Fatty Daddy's has both! The decor is cute and trendy. We enjoyed our ice cream next to a huge picture of Steve Urkel also enjoying some ice cream. They have the ice cream nicely on display and have unique flavors that all sounded amazing. Lots of cereal related ones. I tried cinnamon toast crunch and lucky charms but decided on lucky charms. Soooo good! The best part of that cereal plus ice cream..I couldn't say no to that. My sister and I got it as the little sundae with vanilla macaroons and a toasted marshmallow and shared it. I usually am a big eater and can eat anything no matter how much there is, but my sister and I together didn't even finish it because it was so rich! It was delicious, glad we shared it though haha. Used my yelp check in too and saved some money haha. Only complaint: my sisters friend got a mint chip scoop and there was like two chips in the whole cone, a little disappointing for her, but she did like the ice cream. Otherwise amazing and I've found a new favorite!!",
            "We were looking for a fun new dessert place, so naturally I turned to Yelp! The 5 stars certainly intrigued me so off we went! It's located in a little quiet strip mall, but don't let that fool you! It's super clean and colorful inside and has a very welcoming atmosphere. The owner was incredibly helpful and nice, along with his staff. They were truly excited to have us there and even more so, they were excited about their product which is huge! They have some of the most amazing flavors I've ever seen for ice cream (lucky charms, chocolate birthday cake, captain crunch to name a few)! My daughter and I each got their almost-famous (but-soon-to-be-actually-famous) cookie cup, which had two homemade macaroons (perfectly cooked) with three scoops of whatever ice cream you want, topped with a toasted marshmallow (ummm YUM). My daughter got fruity pebbles flavored macaroons with captain crunch ice cream. The ice cream tastes just like the milk from a bowl of captain crunch along with pieces of the cereal in it! I got vanilla macaroons with mint chocolate chip ice cream. Both creations were amazing!! My husband got a rocky road milkshake that he said was really good. He was a little disappointed they didn't have plain chocolate ice cream, but he admitted the rocky road was delicious! We will be heading here again! I love seeing new businesses succeed and excel at what they do!",
            "I have been wanting to try this place forever and it did not dissapoint!!! It's located in the back with a dirt lot which made it hard to find at first but I appreciate all the parking. We went inside and immediately we were greeted warmly and with excitement. They gave us a walk through about their flavors and some of their specialties. I did the one scoop with toasted marshmallow and a macaron on top. First of all, I love smores, I love ice cream and I especially love MACARONS!!! This was a beautiful marriage of everything I loved in on concoction. It was original but a twist on the classic. The Urkel ice cream was my favorite because Peanut Butter and Chocolate just belong together! The decor is awesome because the art is so unique. I mean, I think I need a giant picture of Urkel licking ice cream in my house now. The chairs were comfortable and I love the blend of colors. Overall, I love this place!! Such an awesome addition to Scottsdale that has it's own unique flair!",
            "I've had this ice cream place bookmarked ever since it opened. Since I bookmarked it, my son, daughter, and mother have been here multiple times bring all their friends. So I finally made it out here on the weekend with my family (of course they all had to come). Everyone warned me that it's really hidden and they aren't kidding. It's in the back of some strip mall with a pretty big parking lot but it's not even lit up. Dark. We walked in and we have two friendly faces just standing there and welcoming us to Fatty Daddy's. Everyone's getting all these samples cause they looked so good. I just got their cookies and cream ice cream as a mini daddy's cookie cup. So you get one scoop of ice cream with a macaroon on top. To top this off is got the marshmallow and they torch it to be nice and crispy. It was so darn good. I got the red velvet macaroon. Everything went so well together. Everything was fresh and creamy. Yummy. Yummy. My daughter and mom never got the cookie cup before and followed my lead. They all love it. My son of course had to get the Fatty Daddy cookie cup which has two scoops with a macaroon in between and on top of the cup with of course an added marshmallow (that is a must). They have seating inside and outside to enjoy this little treat. It just seems like there is a stream of people always coming in. Non-stop. For a hidden gem, everyone knows about this place. They have friendly service with so many options for the cookie cup. Fresh, creamy and down right good. Of course I'll be back to try another flavor but not too often cause that would mean the gym everyday. Just glad it's on the other side of town so I can control myself. Enjoy.",
            "Just realized I never wrote a review for Fatty Daddy's and this place definitely deserves one! I went here a few months back for some desert on my birthday and it was wonderful! It is a little hard to find as it's facing an odd direction in a small shopping plaza but it is a hidden gem. When you first walk in it's quite small with a few tables to sit down at (along with some tables outside) and it's super cute with bright fun colors inside. The lady who was working there was very nice and let us sample as many of the flavors as we wanted as it was our first time there. They have a lot of interesting flavors so I suggest trying a few that catch your eye. My favorites that I tried were the Cinnamon Toast Crunch and the Nutella. I decided on a cookie cup and got those two flavors and a red velvet macaroon, along with the toasted marshmallow on top. I wish I had taken a picture because it looked so yummy, but you can probably already tell by all of the pictures that everyone else has took. Everything about my cookie cup was delicious! The ice cream was of course wonderful, as well as the macaroon, but my favorite was the marshmallow. It was perfectly toasted and was slightly crispy on the outside and so gooey on the inside! I will definitely be coming back here and I can say with no hesitation that this is one of my new favorite ice cream places!"

            "One part ice cream parlor, one part chocolate shop; All parts very cool all the time! As I said in another one of my reviews, Ghirardelli Square was a legend of my youth and an icon in the world of chocolate confection and ice cream excellence. I was here when I was but a lad,. I came here as young man. And now as father, I still have a gleam in my eye when I see this place If you are doing a tour of the stirp, this is one of the must stop visits to one of the great shrines of sweets across the world. This place is smaller and more compact compared to the Original Ghirardelli Square Ice Cream & Chocolate Shop but it has all the important fixings of the original. The store is split right down the middle with chocolate on your right and the ice cream fountain on your left. Unlike the original, the lines are not super long and most of the time you can just order at the counter and find a seat without much competition. Be patient as some folks have never been to any Ghiradelli shops ever so this experience will be overwhelming to chocolate loving n00bs. They're going to gawk and talk and ooo and awe like we all did as they stand in front of the trying to make up their minds which ice cream or if they've gotten all the chocolates they can because they're probably from out of town and quite possibly not from this country. It is Vegas, baby! ;) The atmosphere is comfortable and clean. Sorry, no chocolate making show here. You'll have to make the trek to its Mecca in San Francisco for that. I shared a Crissy Field again. It's a big sundae and one their most prominent to date! The prices are steep for sure ($11 for a sundae!) but you come here expecting that because you're at Ghirardelli's and it's all part of the experience. The Crissy Field is an amazing sundae with three scoops of premium ice cream topped with cookie crumbles, whip cream and their famous milk chocolate squares. The presentation is beautiful and the taste still blows me away. When you're done with your ice cream treat, check out the chocolate section hanging out, filling the entire right side of the store. Their entire selection can be had at various quantities. The packaging and display is confectionery perfect, just like Ghirardelli Square. And because you're visiting, get flavors and treats that are not available in your neighborhood. You'll be glad you did. What's my bottom line? Good? Better than good! I'm coming back on my next visit. My actual rating is a solid 5.0 stars because a chocolate god with its own ice cream joint. No chocolate making show here but it's still the force of is strong in this one...",
            "\"Those were the days...\" It's a new time when we cannot stand hand in hand, not too close to one another. Has life changed completely for us. Can we ever go back to what we hand? What we knew life to be? Sometimes we never knew how good we truly had it, until it was taken away. Summer, winter, fall nor spring is not complete without some ice cream. All that decadence in either a cup, cone, or bowl. Let's stroll a bit and remember how good we had it. The board walk is filled with so many people, the ice cream shop so many choices and variations of concoctions to sample. Confections all around to enjoy and savor. Remember when, these truly were the good old days. The shop so full of fantastic joy and smiles. No frowns can be spotted anywhere. Celebrating whatever milestone we needed the shop provided so many memories for so many souls. The water front site, in San Francisco of Ghirardelli is the most famous of all its locals. As of 1893, this is the manufacturing site of this sensational company. Over the last century the company has undergone some extensive changes. The Ghirardelli name has been known all over the world where ever chocolat is needed. As of the early 1800s the company was shipping its chocolate to ports in Mexico, Japan, just to name a few. During the 1906 earthquake the building was untouched by mothers shakes. One hundred years was celebrated for this company in 1952. Even still the company is on fire; with the next fifty years it become a historical landmark. No stopping here, they launch soda shops first in Florida. The company is acquired by Lindt then they begin manufacturing the wrapped individual chocolates. As far back as I can remember their chocolate has been apart of my life. Let's celebrate another fifty years to this chocolate giant. Who knows what is next for them? Many times while passing the Linq, always the twins have remembered where their favorite ice cream shop is located. When the twins were younger they would settle for a cone with a little whip cream on top, but as they grew no way. The exotic and beauty of the ice cream shop and it's many confections became apparent to them. One of their favorites was either a simple chocolate sundae with extra cherry's or the caramel cup. So many happy memories exist as we walked along Las Vegas Blvd watching everyone enjoy themselves over ice cream again and again. Let life be as beautiful as a dream, that simple ice cream confection can be as it was when you were little. We all have to grow up and some of us loose that childhood glee. We forget that we have the ability to have fun, even though we are grown. Happiness lies in the eyes of a child, but once you were that child. You now have grown so don't loose that smile. Are those moments gone when we used to remember how much ice cream made us smile. They are not gone, they are still inside of us waiting to be rediscovered. Begin as a dreamer then your dream comes to fruition. Your eyes will wander with so many varieties of ice cream they offer. The creative process was alive when they put together the many choices of flavors available in their ice cream and drinks. Everyone is welcome here to choose something from the menu, or create a wonderful new drink. The skies the limit, so dream away. It may seem now that life is dark, but beauty still exists. We shall walk on the board walk again, hand in hand. We shall enjoy the sun and ice cream warms our heart.",
            "Holy yum. A family member was in town from out of state, so of course we were doing the touristy things on the strip - but were trying to carve a new path so we headed to the Linq. We had just enjoyed lunch at Guy Fieri's, and walked down to the High Roller when my chocolate-crazed husband suggested we pop into Ghirardelli - you know, just to look around. Right. I wish I remembered the Manager's name, because he really set the pace for customer service right when we walked in the door. He greeted us with a hearty 'Hello welcome to Ghirardelli' and handed us a sample to enjoy while we shopped. He explained the deal they were running and told us to let him know if we had any questions. All three of us commented on how friendly he was. We did ask questions about the best way to pack the 'to-go' box, and he actually gave us some great tips on how to max out the space :) We all got a shake, and they were delicious. Thick, creamy and perfectly chocolatey. We hung out inside while we enjoyed the shakes, and eventually tried to walk them off down the strip. We'll be back. I hope the same manager is there, he was fantastic.",
            "Who doesn't love Ghiraradelli ?!? This Vegas location is across from in and out near the Ferris wheel. I shared a brownie sundae with my husband, it's super sweet and rich but delightful. The brownies were soft and baked with goodness. Three scoops of vanilla ice cream with placed on top of the warm brownies and a chocolate syrup to drizzled on top. We were able to use our yelp discount with no problem. Also when entering we were greeted with a free chocolate square, pretty much their signature greeting! The location is a nice size plenty of tables to sit and enjoy your ice cream. The service was quick and friendly and everything looked really nice and clean!!",
            "Let's get to the point: they do the chocolate business wonderfully. My go-to's are the hot fudge sundae and their hot chocolates. The hot fudge sundae is absolutely amazing! The ice cream is wonderful but the hot fudge on top of it is the star. My recommendation is getting it with hot dark chocolate fudge, as it is silky and has a hint of sweetness, which pairs well with the already sweet vanilla ice cream. It does not have the bitterness of most dark chocolates, but instead has a deep flavor to it that is satisfying with the ice cream. The hot chocolate is divine as well. The smooth, creamy blend of chocolate is indulgent but not overpowering. My favorite flavor is the sea salt hot chocolate. With the sweetness of the chocolate and caramel within the drink, the notes of sea salt in each sip enhances the chocolate and caramel notes while also giving a flavor other than sweet that the drink needs. I will definitely be back to try their other desserts!"

            "A little backstory: I'm not an ice cream person. That's a strange thing to read, probably, because everyone loves ice cream. But it's true: I've gone months without eating ice cream (gasps). I remember eating gelato from a famous gelato place in Rome (that was in Eat, Pray, Love) and thinking it was OK, maybe even overrated. Initially, I thought it was awesome, but after some thought, I had to wonder if it was the place that made it taste good - Rome being romantic, beautiful and rich in history and all. But Handels ice cream -- I feel like I could eat blindfolded in some dark, dank corner of the universe and still think it tastes great. We Yelp-discovered this ice cream place in San Diego, and I almost fainted when I saw that we have it here in Vegas, too. With Handels, I'm finally excited about ice cream. I'm almost 40, so I've tasted a lot of stuff, and I know my sugar well. Pretty sure I've met my ice cream soulmate with Handel's. I'm also at a point where I think that if I get love handles (Love Handels) from eating Handels, I wouldn't hate myself for it. I'd be like, \"OK\". Handel's makes their ice cream fresh daily. Which means it tastes fresh, and heavenly. I've tried only a handful of flavors so far, but judging by the flavors that I've tried, I feel like the Handels were very discerning in how they developed their flavors. Their ice cream is delicious, but never overpowering. Their pistachio flavor (which I want to try next) should confirm this. Because every pistachio ice cream out there literally tastes like some plasticky almond. We shall see. Love you Handel's.",
            "Believe it or not, there are some people who live in Vegas that think anything under 80 degrees is freezing. Wink wink! But if there's one thing that's going to get them outside to brave the harshest of frozen desert temperatures in the winter, especially if they're the Yelping type, it's ice cream. I don't know much about the history of Handel's, just mainly that they're from Ohio and people all across the country love them. This new location, while possibly different from others I've heard about, is completely walk up service only. It's located in a shopping center on the NE corner of Tropicana & Hualapai. And even with a space size that puts pretty much every ice cream shop in town to shame, there is absolutely no where safe from the elements that is customer accessible. Well, besides their own vehicles of course. With 5+ walk up windows preparing to operate during all business hours, there shouldn't be any problem getting you served up pretty quickly though. On the menu, you're going to find probably way more options then you'll know what do with. There's hurricanes, sundaes, parfaits, ice cream sandwiches, shakes...the list goes on! And if you just want a good ole fashioned scoop or two, there's about 40 or so different choices between the regular ice cream flavors, sherbets and the monthly special. I'm all for having options, but to be honest, there's almost too much here. It could be just be my indecisiveness kicking in, but it was a bit overwhelming. I will say this though. The 4 scoop sampler is one of the coolest things they offer, and I'd imagine it's got to be pretty popular. It's exactly what I ended up going with, and is a steal at only $4.25. It took a while but we ended up going with Banana Cream Pie, Buckeye, Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie and Spouse Like A House (vanilla ice cream with peanut butter ripple and chocolate covered peanut butter pretzels swirled in). Each flavor was spot on with what they described and I'd have a hard time picking out a favorite of the four. The banana had a nice, smooth whipped cream type texture and big chunks of banana. The Buckeye had plenty of whole candies in it, which are basically like a big Rolo, but with peanut butter inside. And both the Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie and Spouse Like A House had plenty of peanut butter flavor without having that terrible frozen peanut butter texture. All were a tad on the sweet side, but very creamy and delicious. The only thing I didn't like is that they all started to melt pretty quick, even in the January winter weather. I imagine during the summer, it'll be tough to finish before you have sugar soup. For being all window ordering, the service is very friendly. Each employee we talked to was very friendly and seemed to be quite knowledgeable about the products. With our visit being on the first day open, I think that's pretty impressive. Adding that to good quality products at great prices, I'll definitely be returning to Handel's!",
            "A taste of the Midwest here in Vegas! The first time I had Handel's was in Ohio & I'm so happy it's made its way here. Located at the in Smith's plaza on Hualapai & Tropicana. You order at the window :) (not a sit in type of ice cream shop). But! They do have benches for you to enjoy your goodies. (As of this moment, they do have signs that state to refrain from sitting on the benches) they also have markers so that you properly practice social distancing. So good. So creamy. It is a must try for everyone! They do not skimp on their flavors. Every bite will have some sort of ingredient. I ordered the blueberry cobbler & each bite had blueberry & scrumptious, sweet crumble along with some creamy vanilla ice cream. Did I mention how their one scoop is tremendously generous?! Your \"one scoop\" is honestly two scoops here. I love their variety of flavors. If you are contemplating which to get, they have a perfect option of a 4 scoop sampler. You can pick any four flavors & they scoop it into a cute little container for you to enjoy at that moment or take home. Speaking of take home, they have hand packed quarts & pints! You can choose any of their 50 flavors to enjoy at the comfort of your own home. It's even more perfect because the weather is getting warmer. You will not be disappointed! have to try their 4 scoop sampler next time so I can try more flavors!!!",
            "As I walked up to the window, the concrete floors were swept, and the stainless-steel countertops were, pun intended, stainless. The red, white, and blue color scheme occupied my line of sight. The pictures posted of the ice cream dropped my jaw to the ground and led a river to flow out of my mouth. The gorgeous atmosphere and savoring pictures give a warm welcome to anyone who approaches. However, the long line of desert hungry people awaiting to have their orders taken haunted me. I stood distraught at the idea of this long line starting at the window and ending at the handicap parking space. The waiting time just get up to the window was around eight minutes; this was a minor inconvenience that can later be redeemed if the ice cream is delicious. On my first visit, I was overwhelmed by the dozens of flavors mounted on the sign. I was taunted by each flavor. It felt like each flavor of ice cream was calling out to me to get a scoop. The multiple freezers you can see inside the store only make you wonder what flavor is hidden inside. Any concoction you can make up, they will probably have it. They had a variety of ice cream flavors such as Chocolate Malt with Caramel, Banana Nut Cake, Coffee Chocolate Chip, and Pistachio. Not only does Handel's serve ice cream, they serve sherbets, ices, fat-free ice cream with no sugar added, and low-fat yogurt (if you want a somewhat healthier option). The manifold of desert options given at Handel's flood your head as soon as you come face to face with the menu. The various ways you can get the ice cream served is also endless. You can get your ice cream served in four different types of cones, in a normal bowl, or even in a quart and pint. Your ice cream can also be made into different variations; they can be served as a banana split, a sundae, a hurricane, and as a popsicle. This variety, for both flavors of ice cream and ways the ice cream is served, really impressed me. Some ice cream shops I have visited just have a couple of tubs of ice cream and they have the option of it being served in a bowl or cone. The fact that Handel's has been able to branch out of being a traditional ice cream shop made me set it apart from any other ice cream shops. Once I got up to the window to order, I found the service to be mediocre, well at least from the person serving me. He greeted me and took my order, but what became prominent is that he did not want to be there, which is understandable. He did not receive me with a smile on his face and he forgot one thing I ordered. The waiting time to get the ice cream in your hands can also take a while as they have to walk away and scoop into a tub of frozen cream and sugar. I then got the ice cream in my hands. I got a tower of the Chocoholic Chunk and I tried Banana's Foster, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, and Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie from those I went with. My ice cream of choice was a chocolate party because the ice cream was very rich in chocolate and had chunks of chocolate all throughout. You had a chunk in each bite, and the best part was that the chocolate was not hard and chalky like the M&M's get in a Mcflurry. As I just got a lick of the three other flavors I can only have a minimal opinion. The Banana's Foster was a blast of banana with a hit of sweet caramel. The Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough had the same big lumps of chocolate and smooth indulgent balls of cookie dough all mixed in a rich vanilla ice cream. The Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie had squares of chocolate rich brownies and scoops of actual peanut butter spread throughout the chocolate ice cream. The intensity of these flavors freezing our tongues made the wait worth it. If the ice cream is this indulging the prices must be outrageous as well. Each type of cone and bowl come with a price less than five dollars. Each of these cones come with a pile of three of more scoops making the price well worth it. The pints and a plate with four scoops of ice cream are also around five dollars. What I believe is a great deal at Handel's is the Two Buck Tuesday promotion they have every Tuesday. Any cone or bowl of ice cream will come down to two dollars each rather than four dollars. If you decide to go on a Tuesday, you better be ready for the long lines! The price point is perfect for a flavor packed scoop of ice cream.",
            "Looking for what is the BEST ICE CREAM in TOWN? Look no further because Handel's is it!!! I first took notice of them back home in San Diego and my friend brought me to their Calrsbad location and when we first walked up it was a little building with a long line outside...that alone assured me that their ice cream was no joke and definitely going to be the talk of the town. Since then, I moved to Vegas and didnt think id ever find Handel's out here until I went to my trusty little app Yelp lol Was super excited that they had a location out here so I made a mission immediately to drive across town to relive that joy I experienced when I took my first bite of cookies n' cream (HIGHLY RECOMMED). Drove up and they had their same store front image with a walk up window and their menu display of all their flavorful ice cream including their eye catching \"cookie monster.\" My gf ordered their banana split, her son got a cookie dough ice cream on a waffle cone and I ordered their pecan praline in a cup. We waited impatiently outside their store because thier indoor seating was closed off but it was fine, since their were benches very close to the pickup window. When we finally got our ice creams, my gf banana split looked amazing and definitely had some weight to it and I was beginning to have a change of heart and steal hers lol but I was being a good boy and stuck with mine...we all started eating our ice cream and we all couldnt help but smile and compliment how smooth their ice cream texture was and just how refreshing it was to finally taste what good ice cream tastes like. Of course the saying goes, whenever its quiet when people are eating that means its a good sign...lol well that stands true 100% When we got done with our ice cream her son looked at me and told me with a huge smile that he gives this place five stars and that it really was the best ice cream in the world...that really made me felt happy to hear him say that and much happier that now we all have a favorite ice cream place to go to now. If you can, make the drive you will not be dissapointed I promise, the only dissapointment would be not ever knowing what good ice cream tastes like and you're just left wondering until you try Handel's!"

            "Holy crap. I'm hesitant to declare anything the best, but this is seriously the best ice cream I've ever had. I ordered one scoop Chocolate Pecan, one scoop Banana on a waffle cone. I love waffle cones, but they're also the more structurally sound choice here--the scoops are really too large to be adequately supported on the regular sugar cone. Flavor: full and with real ingredients. The banana scoop had actual bits of banana and tasted like real banana. The chocolate pecan had entire salted pecan halves embedded throughout creamy, rich semisweet chocolate. Sweetness: not cloying or overwhelming--honey really does give just the right amount of sweetness. Texture: not too hard but not too soft, didn't melt easily, refreshing, creamy with slightly icy texture without inducing brain freeze Price: one order comes with 2 generous scoops for under $4. Crowd: I went on a Sunday night; the lines were pretty long but it moved fairly quickly. This is a real mom-and-pop gem no chain can ever replicate. The quality even tops my all-time store-bought favorites, Ben and Jerry's and M\u00c3\u00b6venpick. I only wish there were a way to send a couple quarts back to my peeps in LA! I'll definitely be back to try the monthly special flavors--can't wait till October to try their cinnamon, pumpkin, and coffee scoops!",
            "Snow flurries in April... but I'm kicking off spring vibes with my first Honey Hut visit of the season! Be warned, you're exposed to the elements walking up to the order window (the patio is out in the open, not covered) but it's absolutely worth it for the delicious, creamy ice cream. It's made with -- you guessed it -- honey! And the patio is a great spot to hang out and enjoy when the sun is out. Honey Hut has all the standard ice cream flavor favorites you're looking for, as well as some less-common treats like banana, orange blossom, and coconut. They also keep it interesting with great monthly flavor specials! Get your scoops in a cup or cone, or make it a sundae and add lots of toppings. You can also get your flavors blended in a milkshake, smoothie, or twister (which is like a DQ blizzard). Our go tos? I love the peanut butter cup sundae.... hot fudge, peanut butter sauce, and lots of chopped up Reese's cups over vanilla ice cream, topped with whipped cream. Hubbie goes for the Oreo twister. And pup takes whatever she can get! Whichever flavor you choose, I'm confident you'll love it. That's why this place is an Old Brooklyn must-visit every summer!",
            "I used to sell Honey on the black market, and I got a good share of the profits (that was my Honey Cut), but I got sick of it (I was in a Honey Rut), so I opened a Crazy Golf course (named Honey Putt). One of my customers became the love of my life... we had nicknames for each other (she was Honey Butt) (I was Honey Nuts), and all was going well until we went bankrupt (Honey Kaput). So we started making adult movies together, and opened our own production company (Honey Smut), and it went so well that we were able to use the earnings to tour the country in search of the best Honey Pecan Ice Cream imaginable. And we found it. And it's in Cleveland. (drops mic) What to get: Honey Pecan Ice Cream Why: Because Honey Butt agrees, it's the best in the country Your dog won't like this ice cream, unless it's a Pecanese. If you close you're eyes, I'll hide your ice cream and we can see if you find it. Count to 40! No Pecan! The funny thing is, I don't even like Honey Pecan ice cream, mainly because I'm not crazy about nuts, but this thing is so good that I don't care - and you won't either. It's always busy here and the Honey Pecan is the reason why. There are several other locations in the area too, but this one is my favourite because it seems like all the cute customers hang out here, not to mention the girl that served me was a total flirt and while I am completely immune to such things... OK fine I'm not immune at all and I loved it. I need to pee and the only thing around is a can. I guess now it's a Peecan. Cleveland has a lot of wonderful places to eat main meals and snacks, but when it comes to dessert treats, you come here for ice cream, and then you go to Biagio's at 4am and get hot-out-of-the-fryer Crulers. And if the cute people here aren't enough for you and you're looking more for Playboy types, go to \"Bunny Hut.\" If you want to date a comedian (like myself) try \"Funny Hut.\" If Cleveland is too dreary for you, try the sister location in San Diego, \"Sunny Hut.\" Or the Bank attached to it \"Money Hut.\" Or the 2 places named after my jokes, \"Crummy Hut\" and \"Corny Hut.\" And if all this has got you a little worked up and hot under the collar, then I'll meet you at \"Horny Hut.\"",
            "We absolutely love honey hut and we would love to come in sometime maybe even on a snowy day, it's so delicious your ice cream is truly the best! my whole family adores your ice cream, the chocolate turtle truffle, the banana split is extremely filling and the size of a party platter to share, the pecan ice cream, the rootbeer floats are refreshing and last all day on perfect afternoons watching a sunset with the love of your life and your kids growing up before your eyes Thank you for showing us the most magnificent tasting food there ever is as a dessert, it is an honor to have tasted such a delicacy.",
            "I've seen their Honey Hut truck around several locations through out the Cleveland area and was always tempted to try it. Idk why I waited so long but there's a lot of places to try and I have only been in Cleveland 3 years. The ice cream was the BEST I'VE EVER HAD! So many delicious flavors and unbelievably creamy! The staff were awesome the two times I've been there and prices are great for the taste and quality. I bought two hand packed pints today (sea salt carmel and key lime pie) which were both hand scooped, packed neatly w plastic over each ice cream before the labeled pint top was placed on and it was put in a cold carry brown bag. Go and enjoy this place, don't wait!!!"

            "I followed Hopscotch's buzz before ever tasting its baked goods. When we first moved to CU in 1993, there was only one upscale bakery in town and we longed for more and different. Now, we have a few to choose from, but more and different is always good. Hopscotch is a new take on the upscale bakery, a hipster one, with a particular decor style that is at once vintage and subdued with a modern twist. Think de-colorsatured roses, flattened, or cakes barely iced with embedded contrasting grit. I like this aesthetic -- it seems fresh and understated to me. I first tasted Hopscotch's products after purchasing them at a local arts pop-up. I bought a brownie and some kind of brown sugar butter bar. The brownie was truly phenomenal if you like fudge (rather than cake) style brownies, and I love them. The chocolate was so dark and dense it was like having my tongue immersed in a deep chocolate groove. The brownie had a soft, chewy bite and wasn't overly sweet. The other bar had good taste: brown sugar meets browned butter, but it was dry and crumbly. When Hopscotch opened in the new Art Mart space, I tried another brownie, and it was as good as the first. So, high marks on consistency. I recently went back and tried a strawberry baby cake for me and a white chocolate brownie for my son. I loved the baby cake itself as well as the fresh strawberry compote on top. The cake was moist and tender, the compote had great strawberry flavor. Neither was overly sweet. I did not like the disc of heavy buttercream frosting that sat on top of these. It had the texture of refrigerated butter and did not eat well with the more tender components. Although I suppose my standard for all such strawberry cakes is the enchanting cassata, a softer frosting would move this baby cake toward perfection. My son did not like the white chocolate brownie, although he loves both brownies and white chocolate. He thought the brownie was greasy and salty. It had moved from a fudgy texture to a fatty one without enough flour to support a good bite. Embedded in the bar were bits of white chocolate, which he said was the only positive note. Given Hopscotch's stiff prices ($8 for a baby cake, $4 for a brownie), one expects products to be truly exceptional, without any missteps. I believe there's real quality here and that products are sometimes worth the price. Hopscotch uses carefully sourced, superior ingredients; good technique; and a refined aesthetic. There's a great deal of potential here, but all of the products are not quite yet perfected. And, to be fair, I haven't yet tried many of Hopscotch's other products, although the case is full of tempting options (full sized cakes, meringues, and more). I will also add that I had one encounter with the owner (Kaya Tate) that disappointed me. When her new website went up, she asked followers on Facebook for feedback. I provided some, much of it positive, especially about the website's look & feel and navigation. However, I also said that I thought the landing page should open with something about the deliciousness of the products rather than ethics, originality, etc. The Hopscotch owner wrote back to defend her choices. I replied that I understood why she'd made those choices -- I get how important food ethics and authenticity (localism, etc.) are to the hipster culinary scene -- but stood by my point that what I want first in a bakery is tasty products. How the products get that way can follow. The owner replied again to defend her choices. To me, this was a misstep in a customer interaction. She had every right to disagree with my feedback, but she should have simply thanked me and moved on. Despite this rather sour interaction, I am rooting for Hopscotch.",
            "A great little place to escape the chilly Illinois weather! I stopped in here for coffee with a friend one day, had never tried this spot but have heard good things (and really wanna check out The Literary as well!) I was just looking for a cup of warmth and maybe a couple of sweet treats. We went in and it was so cute and intimate, a little bar near the window, some tables in the corner to work at, and a nice comfy couch with a gorgeous coffee table in the middle of the space. The walls were lined with various jams, cocktail mixes, teas, and coffees you could buy to try. A great little area to peruse while waiting for your coffee and food. I ended up ordering the Salted Orange Mocha and my friend got a Plain Black Coffee, I paired my yummy mocha with a decadent ooey-gooey salted caramel brownie and a flakey buttery classic croissant. The brownie was so rich and the salted caramel balanced it out nicely so the chocolate wasn't too overpowering. The croissant was very buttery and had a nice crisp flakey outside. The inside was fluffy and had those beautiful croissant layers you look for. My mocha really shocked me, surprisingly I don't typically like chocolate and orange together but I do love trying new things. The orange in this is super soft and doesn't have quite the punch I thought it would, it dances over your tongue and gets enveloped by the mocha. It's a very subtle concoction and I would definitely order it again! Overall this was a great coffee spot and it wasn't too crowded when we went in the afternoon. I think it may be a little overlooked with all the coffee shops on campus and downtown Champaign, I definitely think Hopscotch needs more recognition especially with all their cool coffee creations. I can't wait to go back and see what else they have to offer! * * * Check out my Instagram thatfoodiewithglasses",
            "Vanilla bean cheesecake was decadent and yummy but did not have a hint of vanilla bean flavor. The crust was also rock hard and literally impossible to put my fork through. I really don't understand the point of having such a rock solid crust. Chocolate chip cookie sandwich was soft and tasty. Salted caramel coconut macaroon was delicious (I love caramel and coconut) but was sorely lacking in salt. Salted caramel brownie was very fudgey and decadent! The champagne cupcake was very pretty but bland, did not taste like anything special. Wish they had more cupcake choices. My friends really liked the peanut butter chocolate cake and the birthday macaron. I feel like I tried a good variety of things and wasn't exactly amazed, especially at these prices, but I didn't hate it either. It's essentially just a cute place to take good Instagram pictures and eat something sweet. Service was mediocre, cold and unfriendly. I don't expect people to be in my face with joy and excitement but such a harsh demeanor isn't really necessary. The women who work here definitely aren't giving customers the best experience.",
            "I highly enjoy the creativity that goes into the food and drink items, the decor of the shop, and the variety of things available to try on a regular basis. I also love supporting a local owner. Most of what my family has bought has ranged from very good to excellent. For example, the gluten-free options are outstanding, including the brown sugar oat cupcakes and the carrot cupcakes. The egg-free chocolate cookie is very rich with a distinct chocolate flavor and wonderful texture. I can also attest to the quiche and have tried at least two flavors. Her bread puddings are also terrific. There are some items that aren't a runaway success but am not opting to list those. Instead, here's a handful of reasons why it's not a 5-star review for me: 1) The espresso-based drinks are not always very hot. Temperature is crucial to a really good espresso drink, especially if you are going to spend $5 or more on it. 2) The attitudes of the employees are not always stellar. The last two times I have picked up items from Hopscotch to go, each young woman behind the counter who rang me up were coolly polite at best. There wasn't service with a smile or any kind of cheerfulness, even when I would try to engage about the items. I felt as if I was inconveniencing each of them being there. The first time it happened, I chalked it up to the person having a bad day. But the second time, with a different person, I had someone else with me who also thought it was a stiff transaction for being such a homey place. This might seem like a small thing but for me, this makes the difference of being a regular versus going only once every few months. 3) During peak times, it would be an improvement if there were more than one person behind the counter, e.g. one person making hot drinks and another person helping those in line who are picking out baked goods. Tip: don't go here in a hurry. All in all, a great place to go when you have time, and you want to try locally-made delicious treats or pick up a unique gift for a loved one. It's also conveniently located in the center of town.",
            "I tried to love it. I really did. So much so I tried it 4 times. Their cupcakes and cake slices are so dry. Each and every time. The frosting is so heavy! But this could be a personal preference. The frosting is very thick and taste like pure butter. Savory items are okay. Both items were bland and plain. Again, I tried to love it but I just can't. You can't go wrong with their croissants. Haven't tried their coffee. Three stars for friendly staff, great location, and super cute store. We need more of these please!"

            "I have been following Ice Cream Social since they started as online only business in 2020. I absolutely loved the story behind the shop and their stance on social justice. The owner, Katrina, donates the money from her weekly ice cream sales to organizations in the local community fighting for social and racial equity. Not only is the story amazing, but the ice cream is beyond delicious! It's made from scratch in Madison. They frequently switch out their unique flavors and all the ice cream is gluten free (not that you can tell). So far, I've only tried the monster cookie ice cream. It was absolutely amazing- m&ms and cookie dough in every bite. The ice cream base is so creamy and delicious on its own as well. I can't wait to go back and try more flavors! The shop itself is SO cute! If you've followed Ice Cream Social on Instagram, you know Katrina put her heart and soul into every detail. She hand stained the ice cream bar, designed the sign, picked out all the different paints (possibly painted the shop too) and more. The shop has accent colors of dark blues, yellows, corals, pinks, and whites. It's such a cute combination of colors and works perfectly with all the LED signs and hanging pendant lights. Their official opening date is on Friday, March 11th. You NEED to check it out!",
            "It's week two of their brick and mortar store. While I couldn't attend opening weekend, I might have to say this is a curse and blessing considering I live so close. I've been keeping a close eye on their Instagram to see what flavors were in store for this weekend. There was a line when I showed up a little after 3 but it moves quick. I ordered a flight because who really wants one scoop only? I'd say this would be good for two people although I'd claim to be a hypocrite since I'm devouring a flight by myself. get the waffle cone pieces! Blueberry muffin: literally tastes like a blueberry Opa's birthday cake: has a bit more texture which I enjoy, I'd say sweeter than the blueberry The best is yet to crumble: HOLY MOLY LET ME GET A PINT. It's not as sweet as the other two. There's a pop of tart that really sets off the sweet ice cream vibe. Lots of textures that I love. Last week I had been eyeing up a lavender honeycomb so I'll be keeping my eyes peeled for that. While my body can tolerate gluten and lactose, I can't even tell the difference. **not all flavors are lactose free** I hope this place lasts forever in Madison. They really are bringing their own style to ice cream that sets them apart from the rest. I bought a pre packed pint for a friend who couldn't make it back in time to try the flavors he wanted to. They didn't have any of the best is yet to crumble prepacked but they did it right there when I was to pay. Seating is very limited, maybe 2-4 people, but surely, I can this place running long lines come summer. Easily to stroll around the neighborhood or walk to the lake a few blocks away. Edit 4/10/2022 Best ranking flavors so far. I come here almost weekly... 1. the best is yet to crumb 2. roasted banana 3. lavender honeycomb 4. saturday morning cartoons",
            "We heard about Ice Cream Social from @madisonmusts on Instagram and definitely weren't disappointed. The shop is small but great to pop in, get a dish or cone, and slip out. I got the carrot cake batter ice cream in a dish. Very unique flavor but I enjoyed it a lot. The consistency is good and the scoop is generous. My wife got the doughn't cha know (cookie dough) in a waffle cone and loved it. Great to see new and fun shops like this one in Madison. We'll be back for sure",
            "I love the story behind Ice Cream Social and it's inspiring to see the growth of what it's become now. I'll let you read her story on her website but the motto to know is \"small batches for big change.\" In the beginning when ordered were only going through Instagram, you had to be online and DM right on the dot to get one of the coveted pints. Small batches indeed but so worth it! I appreciate the aesthetic of the brand, the cause of donating a portion of the proceeds to organizations fighting for social justice, and the creativity of the flavors (and names) of each ice cream batch! There are so many unique flavors and I was able to order the 'All Mallows Eve' a spooky delicious treat that's not overly sweet. My weakness is dark chocolate and mixed with marshmallow fluff is a dream. Highly recommend. Congratulations on your continued success. You can currently shop on their site and pick up is at Plasture and Plenty. Looks like a brick and mortar is coming soon! Please deliver to California!",
            "We've been buying ice cream from Ice Cream Social (Katrina) for the last several months, and it's *easily the best ice cream in Madison.* I'll say that again: THIS IS THE BEST ICE CREAM IN MADISON. The flavors are creative, balanced, generously adorned with awesome mix-ins, and always delicious. The waffle cones are some of the best I've ever had (crunchy, maple-y, holds up well to the ice cream). And, the ice cream tastes even better knowing 10% (I think) of the proceeds go toward local charities working toward racial equity and other important causes. Some of my faves: --A Song of Fire and Ice --Lavender Honeycomb --Sage Against the Machine --Knotty or Nice --Salty Bee --Roasted Banana --Sweet Corn with Salted Butter Caramel --The Bees Knees Congratulations on opening your scoop shop, Katrina! Please put the proceeds from my future purchases into the \"Ice Cream Social--East Side Location\" fund!"

            "WARNING: If you are serious about your diet, are diabetic or have other reasons to avoid indulgent sweet temptations don't read this review! I come from the land of Krispy Kreme- not those foolish boxes of stale doughnuts sold at gas stations and supermarkets but the real deal. I'm talking conveyer belt of yummy gooey goodness available 24 hrs a day and a bright red sign alerting the neighborhood that they are indeed, \"Hot Now!\" While I remain a fan of the Krispy Kreme I have to say that Jack Frost is in a completely separate category. Maybe that's why they use the different spellings. These are very different tasty treats! My coworkers introduced me to Jack Frost and it was love at first bite. The icing coming out of the top of the donut ads a bit of sweetness without being TOO much. It's a lovely addition, too. I've had a number of flavors and frankly I can just remember that they were yummy!!!! I have had the chocolate donut (a cake-y one that was german chocolate cake themed) and didn't love it. Had I been new to the JF scene I would have said it was great, but; being the experienced JF devotee I knew it wasn't the top product. Jack Frost does the light colored (plain?) donut best. It's almost fluffy and airy when you take a bite so you can really savor the quality flavor of it. Then (if you've chosen one with the poof of icing) you get a nice soft yet flavorful taste of the vanilla or chocolate, etc. that compliments the donut and top layer of icing. One donut that doesn't seem to come with the icing poof is the maple bacon donut. Yeh yeh yeh- bacon's blowing up/ blown up/ is over but you've gotta give this a shot. Seriously. Consider taking a hiatus from any vegetarian/ vegan dietary commitments you might have made. They do maple great in a number of ways. Something to remember: Jack Frost does not take credit or debit cards. They have taken a check (and the dears actually took my out of state check- I can't bring myself to buy a new box because these are perfectly fine for paying rent which is really the only time I ever use them) and they'll take cash of course! A dozen donuts will set you back a little over $8 and you'll get your money's worth!",
            "I had been waiting months to finally make it out to Jack Frost and I am so happy I did. Holy sugar rush. We came about an hour after opening (8AM) on a Sunday because we were worried about crowds/lines, but it wasn't bad at all - staff was very efficient. The donuts are beautiful and taste like heaven. Seriously. Not only are the toppings decadent and rich, but the actual donuts themselves are just so, so much better than any kind of store-bought or chain donuts. Coffee is great too. Really my only (very very small) problem was that I felt like they had basically two kinds of donuts - glazed or some form of chocolate. Now, don't get me wrong, there is NOTHING wrong with plain chocolate, but I had been hoping for some fruit or interesting toppings (oreo?), but I felt like there was really only glazed or a donut with some variation of chocolate, and I had been hoping to try some unique donuts. They were still delicious though, and my understanding is that they have different kinds every day, so it may just be the day we came. I will definitely be back - it is completely worth the drive and sugar coma.",
            "Time & day of visit: Saturday around 11:30AM, in and out in 10 minutes. Location: I am from Akron so ultimately, I am not familiar with the area but it is easy to get to from the freeway. The parking lot did fill up very quick by the time we were leaving. I actually have a friend looking at moving to the area and I am SO thrilled for the simple fact I can stop at Jack Frost on my way to visit. Service: It was wonderful. They do not label their donuts so I had to ask what a lot of things were but they were so helpful and friendly. They were also nice with recommending a couple things for us to try since it was our first time. Donuts: AMAZING. I believe for 20 minutes after I ate 3 donuts I was in a slight sugary, full belly, amazing, sleepy coma. And it was worth it. I just loved the salted carmel. I also had the chocolate sprinkles and wow. The donuts were a little crunchy on the outside but so light and airy on the inside. Also the frosting was amazing. It any was left on my hands, box, etc, I'd be licking it all. Overall: A must stop for donuts.",
            "If you're down and broke because of how much SMACK COST And you've done so much that you're getting all your TRACKS CROSSED So you go buy a thong so that you can get your CRACK FLOSSED Pour some oil over your shoulder so you can get your BACK GLOSSED You try to win against fracking, but they go ahead and FRACK (LOST) And someone murders your superior, I guess he got WHACK BOSSED And you're getting no action, and your salad really LACKS TOSSED There's only one thing you can do - get donuts at JACK FROST And the award for weirdest rap of all time goes to... What to get: All their donuts are excellent, innovative, and unusual. What not to get: 12 different donuts... these are heavy motherf***ers. You'll be sorry if you do. How to improve: Have some soft, fresh, hot, straight out of the fryer donuts too... fluffy and simple, the way I like them, instead of just cake donuts. To be honest, I don't really like cake donuts. But if I did, I'd be addicted to this place. And even I, someone who prefers soft hot doughy light fluffy doughnuts, can tell the difference between a standard cake donut and an exceptional cake donut. The ones here at Jack Frost are nothing short of exceptional. Five stars is not enough stars for these babies. I've brought a few girls here over the years and there is a consensus. These donuts are spectacular. I've tried probably 20 different things they make (they vary a lot) and have gained quite a few calories from these. They're also extremely friendly in here. For my soft hot gooey donut fix, I go to Biagio's out in Willowick (East Burbs) at 4am when the honey crulers are fresh out of the fryer, and I'm in donut heaven. But if you prefer big, heavy, fancy, bizarre, fun, imaginative and brilliantly made cake donut paradise, then come to Jack Frost, and come will be the operative word once you bite into them.",
            "Don't let the outside of the shop fool you - these are the best doughnuts I've had in a long time. I'm not a Cleveland local, so I don't know how they measure up to others in the area, but when I was visiting my friend and Jack Frost was honored with the \"best doughnut in Cleveland,\" I knew I had to try it. I apologize for not knowing their true/real names (rather than asking, I just stared at the glass and pointed in awe like an idiot), but here are some of the kinds we got: - Bacon maple. Shut up. I love bacon, I love maple frosting, and this guy took those loves to the next level. Crispy, salty bacon on top of sweet, rich frosting. Awesome. - Salted caramel. My friend's mom and dad fought over it because they both took a bite and were furious we just got one. I didn't get a chance to taste it myself (it was gone in a few minutes), but it was described as incredible. - Cinnamon with apple preserves on top: nuts. My friend's cousin said \"I'll just have a bite...\" and it was gone in seconds. Some people have said that the doughnuts are small, and it's true that I've had bigger ones, but I feel like if they were any larger, I wouldn't have been able to stop eating and felt gross afterward. Rather, the size was perfect for a quick snack - and left room for you to try more."

            "I LOVE THIS PLACE. It's pretty close to happiness on earth. Their snowstorms are the best. Be warned, it melts really fast. But the texture is super light and doesn't give you that heavy feeling after you eat ice cream. My go to is their blueberry cobbler. It has blueberries and oatmeal crumbles in their vanilla custard which is absolutely AMAZING It's a great place which outdoor seating to chill with friends and to enjoy the summer weather. Whether you're a local or just here for the weekend, this place is worth prioritizing on your list of places to enjoy a delicious treat.",
            "I live closer to Champaign, and have been enjoying the Jarling's Custard Cup there for a few years now. I recently also visited their Danville location. I understand that there is some kind of \"rivalry\" between fans of each of the two locations, kinda like fans of the Cubs and Cardinals. But, I'm sure it's all good fun, because as far as I can tell, both locations have excellent frozen custard deserts. Jarling's is the first place I ran into the idea of \"cold fudge\". It's just like \"hot fudge\", except that it doesn't melt the custard. Brilliant! Several flavors of frozen custard are always available, in just about any conceivable configuration. I've always found the service to be friendly at both locations, and the treat to be just the thing for either a hot summer day or warm summer evening. Bring friends. There's really nothing like sharing an experience like this with friends. That's how I first learned of this place, when friends from work invited me along for a Friday afternoon \"meeting\".",
            "A Champaign-Urbana institution, Jarling's isn't very fancy schmancy. There's nothing foofaraw about this place. But it's held in high esteem by locals and visitors alike. And for good reason: It's a gem of an ice cream place, serving delicious cups of happiness every summer. Despite being a no-frills establishment, the frozen custard here isn't very cheap. At times, lines can be long as well. However, the awesomeness factor of Jarling's custard's pretty much unrivalled. It's totally worth the wait and the extra buck or two you'll have to spend. For what it's worth, even Tom Hanks has tweeted appreciation of the custard here. As a Hollywood superstar who hasn't trodden into Food Network territory, Tom Hanks may not be a famous foodie like Guy Fieri but hey how many ice cream places can boast of *any* celebrity endorsement at all? :)",
            "I love this place.... it is five stars. Their cold fudge is the best. Yes, it may not be real custard --- Culver's is closer to custard than Jarlings, but still Jarling's is AMAZING. My only gripe ---- since changing owners..... it was the Friday before Labor Day --- September 4, 2015..... the local pools are celebrating their last weekend of the season. It's 94 degrees out....it's going to be mid 90's all weekend long..... wow, Jarling's would really hit the spot on this super hot sunny weekend..... oh wait.... the parking lot is empty....the barricades are up. Sign in the window says, CLOSED FOR THE SEASON. Hello?!?! It's still summer!!! It's not even Labor Day..... you closed four days ago on August 31st?!?! What the hell?!??!!!!",
            "Jarling's, how I love you!! A venerable Chambana institution, Jarling's, otherwise known as Custard Cup, is one of the best things about summers in this East Central Illinois college town. It's open from March through mid-November or so, but during the summer be prepared to wait in line a bit, especially at night on the weekends. Oh, and don't forget, it's cash only! My favorite is the pumpkin pie snowstorm, it is DELICIOUS. They have the perfect blend of vanilla custard with bits and pieces of pumpkin pie...but it's seasonal so you have to be sure to get it in the fall while it's available. I can never pass up an opportunity to drop by Jarling's. In fact, the last time I was here, it was during the break between a friend's wedding ceremony and reception (hey now, it just happened to be on the way!)... In 3 words: OH SO GOOD!"

            "If you're ever wondering where to get the best ice cream in the city, I'd highly recommend stopping by Jeni's before you head back home. Situated right in the middle of Southend, it's surrounded by sprawling restaurants, breweries, and eateries. Why not swing by after lunch or dinner and get some delicious dessert? That's the thought on everyone's mind; you'll always witness a large line no matter what time of day it is (with the night time being the most packed). It's a small little shop right next to Hawkers with minimal seating inside but lots of tables and chairs outside. Even though the lines can get massive at times, it always seems like it's worth the wait! As you get closer and closer to the entrance, you're greeted with a waft of fresh waffle cones being made constantly. The smell is inviting and definitely is a significant part of the experience. Once inside, you're greeted by a scooper and asked to pick and choose what flavors you want to try out and which ones you'll ultimately get. I'd recommend the Frose or the Wildberry Lavendar but I'm sure there's a choice to satisfy anyone's tastes! Once you check out, you can usually find seating outside on their tables or waltz over to the open area of Hawkers and sit there too. I usually like to chat with my friends while people watching, as there are usually lots of pets and little kids running around (making the atmosphere extremely welcoming and family-friendly). Ultimately, with the combination of how delicious Jeni's ice cream is, as well as it's welcoming atmosphere it's a sure winner during the peak summer months as well as any other time you decide to go. It's definitely one of the best experiences you could have, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone!",
            "This place is so dope (that's what we say in NY) on so many levels! 1. Location. Plenty of on street parking 2. Jeni's itself is just super cute and adorable. Love the set up outside and inside as well. Very welcoming. Lots of lightening and just super airy and open. 3. The staff is amazing! Super friendly, warm, and inviting. I can't wait to go back! Love their honesty. If they didn't know something they didn't pretend to know. They went to ask the manager. 4. Being allowed to sample as much as as little as you pleased was a HUGE surprise but greatly appreciated. The portions were super gracious. 5. THE FROSE is life! All of the ice cream I tasted was amazing but man oh man the Frose!!! I am just speechless. Honestly thought the first time I had Jeni's was in Charleston just a couple months ago. Best ice cream I ever tasted. While there, one of the workers asked me where I was from and when I told her Charlotte she told me they would be opening a location there this year. I never dreamt it would be this soon. The opening of this place has totally made my summer. We were all warmly welcomed and the atmosphere was just super chill, laid back, and friendly.",
            "I have a love affair with Jeni's that started a few years back when I discovered their pints at whole foods and would shell out 10 bucks weekly for a pint of brown butter almond brittle. So imagine my excitement when I found out Jeni's was opening a Charlotte location. Parking is usually horrible, so be prepared to walk quite a few blocks. But it'll be worth it when you walk into the store and are enveloped in the warm aroma of freshly made waffle cones. There's a huge blackboard menu listing all the flavors, including seasonal ones. The ladies behind the counter are super nice and did not seem the least bit annoyed when I asked to sample 6+ flavors (this was just the first time I was here and there was nobody behind me, ok). I liked everything I tried, so choosing 3 was a difficult choice. My favorite was the gingerbread cognac - the gingerbread chunks and strong cognac flavor paired so well together and was texturally what I need. Also enjoyed the white chocolate peppermint, with white chocolate chips intermixed. Both of these are seasonal. Also really like the peanut butter and strawberry jam flavor - which is dairy free! I wouldn't have guessed at all. Roasted pb and tart jam swirled into a creamy base. I like the fluffernutter flavor for similar reasons. I'm into the cool and unique flavor combos, but I went with a few ice cream purists who just got plain chocolate - the darkest chocolate is quite good. So there's something for everyone. The trio is the perfect size if you want to try multiple flavors. Comes with small pieces of waffle cone. Kind of expensive, yes, but definitely worth the money. Some window bar seating inside and tables outside. Will return every chance I get.",
            "A great ice cream recommendation I was given! I had seen/heard of Jeni's before but never got around to trying it. I am very happy I finally did so! They have a decently wide selection of flavors, at least 1/3 of which are unique and I have never seen/heard of. They provide options where you basically get flights of ice cream, which is super great to share amongst friends and/or family! One option is the trio where you can choose up to 3 flavors of your choosing whereas the other option is literally a flight of 10 of their most popular flavors (substitution allowed). If you're a huge ice cream fan and want to try basically all their flavors, you won't go wrong with the flight of 10. When I went they had 13 flavors available... That being said, with the flight, you'd basically be tasting all their flavors! My personal favorite were probably the Lavender and Whiskey Butter Pecan. The Lavender flavor wasn't overwhelmingly aromatic, which I really appreciated. The lavender flavor was probably more on the subtle side, which was very well complemented by another, almost citric-like flavor that overall made the tasting experience unique and phenomenal. The Whiskey Butter Pecan tasted exactly as it sounds. The alcoholic kick wasn't overbearing at all; to me, it really brought forward the butter pecan flavor. The quality of the ice cream resounded Artisan in my head with eat mouthful. You can definitely taste the difference between their ice cream and for example, store bought ice cream (a blasphemous comparison, I know). They even describe their ice cream production standards on their napkins, which I think is very creative. If you haven't tried them already and are in town, definitely do try to make a stop to try the ice cream here!",
            "I continue to awe at the amazing flavor quality of Jeni's ice creams! You can tell so much detail and care goes into each flavor. I'm so happy Charlotte has three locations (with this one and NoDa being a bit bigger than Park Rd Shopping Center)! Literally any flavor you get is amazing. I don't have a favorite because I love getting different flavors each visit -- and that's easy to do because there's always new seasonal flavors coming out. And can we talk about the drool worthy aroma that hits your nostrils as soon as you walk in?! I love the smell of freshly made waffle cones. I love that you can also see them roll fresh ones behind the counter. All of the locations are decorated with the same vibrancy -- it makes for a great atmosphere. This location has a good handful of seats inside and outside, so you can beat the heat if you're lucky. The fact that Jeni's is always so welcoming to Yelpers is also another reason why I adore them so much! They care about their customers and the products they offer them."

            "We dropped by because of Lavazza, but we're intrigued by La Pasticceria's beautiful desserts instead. When we were waiting in line/admiring the beautiful array of desserts, two Italian gentleman in front of us specifically requested the medium sized tiramisu, which could not be found in the case. When I ask them about it, they told me it's oh so good, it's dangerous. I don't know about you, but that kind of comment always makes me so curious that I gotta give it a try! We ended up getting a passion fruit tart and the tiramisu, then we proceed to the seating area to dig into the goodness. We both loved the passionfruit tart. It was crunchy, sweet and refreshingly tarty. My boyfriend was very happy with it since he's a big passionfruit fan. I was really impressed by the tiramisu, as the coffee, custard and dark cocoa powder played magic on my taste buds. I was never a tiramisu aficionado but now I finally get the hype. Those two were right, it was so tasty I couldn't stop eating it (danger to my waist line)! Overall, I'm happy we came visit and got some awesome pastries. If you get a chance, definitely pay a visit, grab some coffee and try their medium size tiramisu. You won't regret it!",
            "Love it! OMG! This little Italian dessert shop inside of Eataly is phenomenal! You're going to have some decisions to make when you get here! Everything looks delicious (and probably is!)! We liked it so much, we went twice in one day! My favorite out of everything was the tiramisu pudding/dessert. It's the best! It had small pieces of tiramisu cake mixed in the pudding. The taste wasn't too sweet or bitter, it was just right. All of the desserts are authentic. Eating dessert here took me back to the days when I visited Rome and other Italian cities some years back. They also have a small coffee shop. I ordered a tiramisu iced coffee. It was good too but not as good as the dessert. It had a little bit of booze in it. Imagine...coffee and booze together at around 9 am? Lol. I also ordered a slice of chocolate cake with hazelnut mixed in. It was tasty as well but a bit dry. I took a couple of bites from my bf's desserts. Very good as well. We don't recall the names of them. Sorry! He ordered a hot chocolate in the morning and it was delicious! The taste wasn't too rich or sweet. Definitely stop here if you're in the area and into sweets. It's really close to New York New York and the MGM Grand. It took us about eight minutes to walk here from MGM. Aside from this shop, there's a variety of Italian foods and products to choose from in the other shops. There's also a casino in the back. I say any dessert you choose from here will probably be delicious. It's the tiramisu that does it for me! By the way, they change up some of the desserts they have in the morning during the afternoon. The service here is impeccable. I would give this spot more than five stars if I could. Totally recommend! :)",
            "YUMMY! After having lunch at another spot in Eataly, I was craving something sweet, so we ventured over to La Pastcceria. As an Italian girl myself, I had to try a cannoli, as it's my most favorite dessert. Now be warned, my Mom makes the BEST cannolis, so I am always skeptical when I try one at a restaurant or Italian style bakery, but these cannolis are delicious! I would've had another one, but I was already stuffed from lunch...lol! My husband who is not a cannoli fan had mini cream puffs, and he said they were super yummy too! La Pastcceria has several other sweet treats to try too, and they are all so pretty and look yummy!",
            "There's an endless selection of Italian food options inside Eataly, but don't miss out on La Pasticceria to satisfy your sweet tooth after a home made Italian pasta meal. Or just skip the entree and go directly to dessert, as I did today! Your biggest dilemma here will be choosing among all the beautifully presented dessert. I didn't go wrong with the Ciccio, a cream puff filled with Chianti cream. The juxtaposition between the slightly crisp pastry dough and the sweet fresh cream was a party in my mouth. It left me craving just one more, but I resisted...this time. Not coincidentally, \"ciccio\" in Italian means chubby. Desserts here also make a nice hostess gift. Choose from their whole tortas to containers of fresh made tiramisu.",
            "My friend strongly recommended La Pasticceria for the pastries, so I made my trip here to try those out. WOW. I forget how eye-pleasing it could be when checking out the pastries while waiting in line. I was very tempted to get all of them-but my wallet would cry if I did. For my first try, I decided to get Apricot Croissant and Nutella Croissant. I did not disappoint! Those were so good and I came back the next day to buy some before heading home. My roommate gladly accepted the untraditional souvenir from Vegas :P FOOD + Apricot Croissant - light, fruity. I wish the apricot jam was evenly spreading out in the croissant + Nutella Croissant - can't go wrong with nutella, but... (read next line) + Chocolate Croissant - if I have to choose between Nutella Croissant vs. Chocolate Croissant, I'd pick Chocolate. I'm not sure why, I just like it better + Cream Croissant - recommended by a stranger who lined up in front of me. Yummy! AMBIANCE Located in Eataly, it was quiet in the morning at 8-9am when I stopped by. I came back to dine at another restaurant later for dinner and it was really loud and crowded. Service Staffs were sooooo friendly and nice. They were very patient too. Bonus The paper bag is really cute :P It's on the pricier side, but it's nothing wrong to treat yourself when you are in Vegas, right? Best way is to share with family/friends so you can try a little bit of everything. Also, morning should be less hectic!"

            "This place is such a cute icecream shop! I love the booths and stools- perfect photo ops! Usually if a place has great photo op moments I don't care if the food is that good. I expect mediocre. But their icecream was great! I got black cherry and rocky road in a waffle cone. The black cherry flavor is to die for. I don't even like cherries! I saw the girl getting a scoop for someone else and it looked amazing- asked for a sample- definitely amazing. We went this past Saturday (9/23) and the girls closing the store were so nice and sweet! Even when a couple came in 6 minutes before close and a gentleman maybe 1 min before close- they greeted them brightly and with a smile. I thought to myself \"that's good customer service.\" Friendly staff, great icecream, and cute photo ops... 5 stars for sure!",
            "Mary Coyle and me go way back. Admittedly thats a common refrain you'll hear from longtime customers of one of the valley's oldest ice cream shops. But its also true for me. I've been a Mary Coyle customer since I was a teenager, and my Mom was a customer back when she was a teenager. It's no wonder that after 66 years, this place still attracts pretty much every age group and demographic imaginable. But today it was time for something new. Namely their new location on 7th Street just a block south of Bethany Home Road. My last visit was at their old location. Would this location have the same magic? I should parse my description of Mary Coyle's old location in part because this is now the third stop for this ice cream shop. Mary Coyle herself opened her original ice cream shop back in 1951 on the corner of 15th Avenue and Thomas. Then in 1996 the shop moved to 7th Avenue just north of Missouri. This was the location I always went to growing up. The 7th Avenue location was spacious with seating for probably 100, but was more of a restaurant as they had lunch and dinner items to go with their ice cream staples. I came here a bunch of times especially during my high school days and in fact probably a dozen or so of my high school classmates worked here at one point. And of course I came here often with my family where would we usually tackle one of their giant family sized ice cream monstrosities. We took on both the Hill and the Mountain, but never the Grand Canyon (read the menu for the full descriptions of these, and yes they're as insane as they sound). The new location by contrast has seating for maybe 30. Gone are the lunch and dinner menu items. Instead its all about the ice cream, the thing that made Mary Coyle a treasured name in the valley. Much of menu looks familiar from the sundaes to the banana splits and even those giant family size ice cream items I just mentioned. One menu column I didn't recognize was the Showboats. Perhaps I missed that menu column during my past visits, but the bowls sounded positively divine when I read over them. So on a Sunday, I came in for a Sundae, but opted for a Showboat instead. One in particular. The Cookie Man. Cookies and cream ice cream, chocolate sauce, crushed Cookies, marshmallows, whipped cream, and a cherry. Yup, we have a winner. Total for a regular sized Cookie Man including tax came to just under $10. Alright, let's talk about \"regular sized\" for a moment. There are actually two sizes for these bowls. Pippen and Regular. Somehow in my mind I thought I remembered the Pippen size being pretty small based on the desserts I'd had here in the past. Thus I opted for a Regular size just to be sure. The odd look I got from the gal at the register probably should've tipped me off to what was being sent to my table. Folks, the Regular size bowl is massive. So massive that as soon as it was put on my table, little kids were staring at me with amazement and adults were laughing as if to say 'have fun with that, you idiot'. These regular sized bowls are definitely meant to be shared by at least two (probably closer to 4), so you can imagine my horror at this point. Out of sheer stubbornness I tackled it anyway. And the good news is this was an ice cream concoction definitely worth the effort. The flavors are fantastic (particularly the crushed cookie pieces and marshmallow). There were probably 10 scoops of ice cream in this thing, but they apportioned the toppings out very nicely. Believe it or not, I actually did finish it (to the astonishment of people sitting next to me), but I'm honestly kind of ashamed that I did. That was seriously a lot of dairy and I've probably ruined dinner tonight and breakfast tomorrow morning. But if its my last meal for 12 hours, boy what a last meal. Props to the owners of Mary Coyle for resurrecting this Phoenix institution and bringing it back to its roots. The location may be new, the setup may be smaller, but the great old school ice cream creations that made Mary Coyle famous are still going strong. Now if you'll excuse me I need to nap off this epic dairy coma.",
            "Sweet Treats It has been a very long time since I revisited Mary Coyle's and a few things have changed. Lunch items are no longer offered on the menu, this place had the best BLT sandwich that was loaded with bacon. Even though the lunch items are gone Mary Coyle's is serving up some of the most delicious sweet treats, some of the best ice cream in town. On this visit my lunch companion and I shared the Caramel Cashew \"God Bless You\" and the \"Thick Ol' Fashion Chocolate Milkshake\" and both were delicious. The \"God Bless You\" was the perfect mix of Vanilla & salted caramel cashew ice cream, caramel topping, topped with cashews, whip cream and a cherry on top. The ice cream was smooth, rich and full of flavor as was the chocolate shake. If you're ever craving delicious homemade ice cream, great customer service, and wallet friendly prices, stop in you won't be disappointed.",
            "Since I've lived here 20+ years, I've been to all Mary Coyles' former locations. Thank goodness someone bought this local biz from the original owners so we can still indulge. MC's latest location on Central is closer to me so I'm thrilled about that fact! I've been here twice in the last two weeks & both times employees have been super nice, followed safety protocols & served up MC's usual homemade deliciousness. Last time I came with a friend: I got a cake cone with Peppermint Ice Cream. Creamy & refreshing! My friend got a waffle cone with Black Licorice - unusual flavor so mad props on that, but could have been more licorice-y. Second time, I came solo & got a cup of Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream. Superb flavor because refreshing AND studded with semi sweet chocolate chips, NOT chocolates flakes or itty bitty pieces of chocolate, but full on CHIPS. What's their most popular flavor? Salted Caramel with Cashews. Never would've guessed that one...so gotta git it next go round! Here's how they're ensuring a safe experience for employees & customers, during Covid-19 times: * workers wear masks & gloves * everyone that came in (three different people + me wore masks) * seating areas are blocked off so social distancing is enforced, except for one booth that is available Plenty of parking options: 1) Turn on Encanto & there are spaces BEHIND the shop. 2) Street parking on Encanto 3) Street parking on street just north of Mary Coyle's, West Vernon. That's where Birdhaus Coffee shop is... Much appreciation for the simple experience of sharing ice cream with friends or family at Mary Coyle's right now!",
            "I've said many times that there just isn't a good place to get a classic sundae in Phoenix. Well I stand corrected! Mary Coyles definitely delivers if you just want some classic, tasty ice cream and old fashioned sundaes. The shop isn't huge but it's nice, cute and was very clean when we arrived. There were two younger guys working but they were so nice and helpful, explaining the menu to us and promptly making our treats. We got a coffee milkshake and The Cookie Man \"A Monster\" with vanilla ice cream instead of cookies n cream. Their \"showboat\" sundaes come in either 5 or 7 scoops but they did say they could do them in 2 or 4 if that was too much. Let me tell you, if you aren't sharing, go for much less than 5!!! The milkshake was honestly perfect. So tasty. The cookie man was HUGE but satisfying. Again, I would highly recommend sharing their sundaes or ordering smaller ones. They also have several extremely large options (one called the Grand Canyon which is more than $100 I believe) for groups and the novelty/fun. If you want no frills ice cream or need a break from the fancy, unique flavor trend, this is the place to be. Great service and good product. I'll be back!"

            "It has been more than a year since I left my original review (preserved below) for Mason's Creamery. If anything, I like Mason's more than ever. Here's a comprehensive review of my year with Mason's Creamery. -- Short & Sweet: These are good people who care about their community and who provide a unique and high quality product at a reasonable price. As long as they keep it up, I will continue doing my part by eating their delicious ice cream (and sporadic ramen.) It's a sacrifice, but someone has to do it. (PS they'll let you sample whatever you want, so be adventurous!) --- Full Update: Last year I tried at least a couple dozen new flavors, enjoyed many good conversations with friends on the benches outside, told everyone who would listen that they HAVE to try Mason's if they're true foodventurers, converted a few people to love Mason's as much as I do, and only missed one of their ramen events. This year, I expect more of the same. What's so great? The ice cream, for one. Every single flavor I have tried - even the ones that weren't my cup of tea - were very high quality, excellent texture, and unique to Mason's. The prices are reasonable and the staff is always friendly. It gets better... in the last year, I have interacted with the Mason's crew on social media. The owner regularly praises his crew. He respects them, understands their value, and sees them as a family in some ways I think. I feel great supporting a business where employees are treated with kindness and respect. These are good people who care about their community and who provide a unique and high quality product at a reasonable price. As long as they keep it up, I will continue doing my part by eating their delicious ice cream (and sporadic ramen.) It's a sacrifice, but someone has to do it. My Original Review: This is a local gem that should be on every Clevelander's (and every visitor's) list. I've been wanting to try it for a while... everything and more I hoped it would be. They let us flavor anything we wanted. Considering the unique flavors, that's a great policy. I settled on sweet potato marshmallow ice cream in a waffle cone (I swear it tastes JUST like it!) My wife got an affogato with white russian ice cream. The staff was really friendly - no snobbery! They gave excellent customer service. It was a fun outing even though it was freezing outside.",
            "Mason's Creamery is probably one of my favorite places in Cleveland. I thought I had written a review years ago, when I first tried it, but guess not! First of all, I'm truly inspired by the owners, Jesse and Helen, who took this corner shop from what seemed like a dingy, run-down building, to a bright and colorful beauty of what it is today. And it's thriving! I hope to do something similar in the future. Serving small-batch experimental ice cream flavors when the weather is nice out and switching to a full-time ramen shop in the winter. They still have one to two options of soft serve and ice tea to sip on the side during ramen time. Every time I come here, they're adding something new - from finishing the outdoor area with the benches, to the mural on the side, to patio area that extends the indoor seating (with heaters in the winter). What I love the most, is that they take suggestions for flavors and actually make them a reality - from cereal flavors, to beer infusions, from tea flavors - you name it! My favorites have been their thai tea and vietnamese iced coffee flavors. They really are small-batch because I once went two days in a row and the thai tea one was OUT (heart breaking, right). The staff has always been so friendly and welcoming - for example: one time my friend had gotten so excited to try one of the three scoops she got in her cup...and she dug into the top scoop, which immediately fell on the floor. They replaced it, without charge and without making a big deal about it. Their blueberry sorbet was the best I've ever had before. It tasted like actual blueberries and was super refreshing - not like some of the artificial flavors you get elsewhere. If you're feeling really extra, get the churro ice cream sandwich, with your choice of ice cream. And/or, order churros on the side with the chocolate dipping sauce. Yuuuumm!! They make the churros fresh, so note that there will be a short wait for it (the wait is worth it). For their ramen shop, don't be afraid to try the veggie ramen - that broth is PACKED with flavor. I actually like it better than the pork one. But I like to compromise and order the veggie ramen and add pork belly to it, for an additional charge. They have chili oil available if you want to add some spice to your ramen. I'm already planning when I'm going to Mason's again to grab the ramen before it's gone. But that just makes me even more excited for the warmer weather, seeing all the doggos who visit, and, of course, the ice cream!",
            "Every time I go to Mason's I'm blown away by the amazing flavors. Every time. Just when I think I've found a new favorite flavor, they put out something new, fun, and inventive, and I have a new favorite. On my most recent trip, we stopped in for a late night treat. The staff was super friendly and chatted with us and pet our dog. They let us try some flavors to help us decide. Honestly, I wanted to try every single flavor, but stopped myself and just tried a couple. I settled on a scoop of cookie butter (!!!!) and a scoop of cocoa puff (with cocoa puff cereal topping). Both flavors were out of this world good. The cookie butter basically tasted like Trader Joe's cookie butter straight out of the jar. And the cocoa puff tasted like chocolate cereal milk, it transported me right back to my childhood. my boyfriend settled on french toast (with a maple syrup topping) and brownie batter. I got a taste of both and they were great. I would definitely recommend the french toast, and the brownie batter was good, not a rich as you would expect, which I really liked. We also split an order of churros, which they brought out to us, just made and still warm. OMG so good. the perfect pairing with that delish ice cream. Bonus, they also gave us a mini scoop of vanilla for our pooch. In an edible cup, in case he decided to eat that too. I thought that was so cool, I love any place that loves dogs. I'm not kidding when I said I wanted to try every flavor. Everything was just so fun and inventive. They have flavors that I've never seen anywhere else, and every single one sounded so good. I'm excited to go back and try the Thai tea flavor. They also have a bunch of vegan flavors, usually at least 3-4 every time I'm there. The vegan strawberry jam is my favorite so far. They're doing great things here, they're making some of the best ice cream I've ever had.",
            "Seriously am in love with this place! I am an ice cream lover, so whenever I travel I have to try the best ice cream around and I think this is it! So when you ask people what is the best ice cream in Ohio, many people will name the big most common names of ice cream but that wasn't what I was looking for...I was on the search for the best ice cream, the diamond in the dirts...the gems and I found it here on Bridge Ave (it took a lot of searches on my end). The location is probably an area I would never go to if I was just driving around, luckily I knew where I was going. Upon entering there was a beautiful outdoor seating area but it was too cold to sit down so I went in and was immediately greeted by the people in the front. The customer service was amazing, they strongly encourage you to sample every flavor as every day the flavors change. All of their ice cream and sorbet are freshly homemade. They even provide for vegans! I was so hesitant on what to get as EVERYTHING was soo good but I heard that they were known for their churro sandwiches in which it is a warm churro in between two scoops of ice cream which can range flavors. I got the churro sandwich with graham cracker and ginger snap ice cream and it was delicious! The churro was so warm and it melted the ice cream so delicately. The ice cream is served with a spoon that changes colors which is so cool! This place has been open for 2-3 years and is literally amazing--all for $6!! I encourage everyone to check this place out! Great customer service, delicious freshly made ice cream, and great options! I am spreading the word on this hidden gem! P.S. They even honor military discounts.",
            "The best local ice cream around! Mason's is the perfect pick me up, any day of the week! We live right around the corner, and stop in probably once a week. I love how they are so adventurous with flavors and concoctions and they really do take in all the feedback they receive to make the best ice cream possible. They certainly have interesting flavors, but they always have amazing classics as well! The couple, Jesse and Helen, who run the place are the sweetest ever, which makes me love coming by even more. They have done a lot for the community and it makes me thrilled to have people like them in our neighborhood. Also, one of the best parts is the staff is so generous and love dogs, that they always give my sweet pup a free doggy scoop of vanilla ice cream! Also make sure you try out their ramen nights - they are delicious but get there early as the line is killer! They also do fun movie nights in the summer and bring in food trucks. Just the best!"

            "How have I not already reviewed this place considering how often I try to drop by when I'm in the matthews/ballentyne area! This is a MUST TRY if you're in Charlotte. Okay so this place is amazing and you absolutely need to visit to get your matcha ice cream and other dessert options as well! It's a small cafe with much-limited capacity due to COVID but they're accomodating and doing their best which I appreciate! The ice cream is definitely the must get item for 1st timers since it's creamy and delicious as well as pretty accurate to the matcha flavors I've had in Japan. The vanilla with matcha is a good match if you're not used to the bitter taste of matcha that can be acquired, but that combination is great no matter what! I've also had hojicha (burnt matcha?), black sesame (seasonal), and ube (seasonal) and all those are great as well! Hojicha is still one of my favorites with match ice cream. The black sesame is good as well if it's an option. The ube is a lot lighter than I expected so if you're expecting that rich flavor you've had a Filipino places, you might have to curb your expectations a little bit. I've only had the other matcha ice cream with all the toppings that I forget the name of and I'd also recommend that if you're in a hungry mood or want to share! I've had that several times in Japan and this place is up to par for this dessert option! Parking is pretty easy and there's a lot of food options in the area. Or if you want boba, kung fu tea is also a short walk down because my mom wanted boba more than ice cream so there's room for everyone :D I'd say drop by if you're in the south charlotte/Matthews/Ballantyne area, but really if you're in Charlotte this is a MUST STOP AREA you have to try. It's unique and leaves a lasting great impression.",
            "I loved the aesthetic, the food, the service-everything! I love sweet treats but I do not like when they are too sweet. The sweets at Matcha Cafe Maiko hit that perfect balance of sweetness and flavor. I tried the Maiko special with a mix of vanilla and matcha flavors and immediately fell in love with this place. Besides amazing flavor, the Maiko special has so many ingredients that blend effortless well with each other. The toppings are layered so when you mix it all up you can get a mix of soft and crunchy in every bite or leave it as it is. I've had good desserts but I haven't had one as unique as this in a long time. It's also pretty filling so it's great for sharing with a friend! p.s. the Madeleine matcha cookie was also very good",
            "Words and pictures can not express how amazing Matcha Cafe Maiko is, but I will try to articulate it anyway. Tl;Dr If I could, I'd give them ten stars. They are truly a unique and aritisan cafe that takes pride in their craft. You would be a fool to not go here. Let's break it down: The digs: Located in a shopping complex off Providence Rd near the Arboretum with plenty of parking. The decor is beautifully done. Clean and simple lines with a calming color scheme. The furniture is fun and modern and doesn't look cheap or kitschy. The people: I'm not positive, but I'm fairly certain that the owners were there when we ordered. They love what they do and are so kind, helpful, and informative. I really do wish them the most success with this endeavor. The menu: As the name suggests, they specialize in matcha everything. They have a mix of cold and hot drink/snack options. However, I'll make things easy for you. GET THE MAIKO SPECIAL! It's your choice of soft serve flavors with all sorts of layered goodies; almost like an elevated parfait. I recommend the hojicha soft serve, which is roasted matcha. It has a wonderful complex and nutty flavor. As for all of those goodies, they include but are not limited to mochi, cornflakes, chiffon cake pieces, and red bean paste. The combination of textures and flavors are phenomenal. And oh by the way, everything is made in house. I mean you really can't beat that.",
            "If you like your matcha super sweet, steer clear from the Green matcha and try the Hojicha. The green matcha has that authentic bitter taste to it. It's sweet but not super sweet. It's very balanced. If you love super sweet matcha, get the float. The latte enhances the sweetness. Honestly, cannot go wrong with anything here. I usually get the swirl cone - matcha & hojicha. Best of both world.",
            "Not a big fan of Matcha, but I have to give this place a five star . A very nice, beautiful, cute, fancy little place. Clean, bright, friendly atmosphere. Never wanna try matcha until come to this place and give myself a shot, not bad not bad but matcha still not my things tho...but again this place so welcoming, so instagrammable, matcha lover out there, this is all about matcha...this is your place, come and try this out....they have good selection of matcha..."

            "It always makes me sad when I come here and my favorite flavor is out of rotation. I miss Strawberry Balsamic more than I've missed any ex-girlfriend but I love late night trips here because there's always something new to discover and love. Lemon Olive Oil previously and Cucumber Mojito Sorbet tonight. Those flavors may not be your style but I don't like sweets and this place gets me excited for bold creative flavors beyond their delicious fudge, coffee, Cap'n Crunch, Fruity Pebbles, and other standard fruit flavors. Staff is awesome and the patio is nice, comfortable and full of friendly people. The neighborhood is the South Roosevelt Arts District with great stores, bars and restaurants to enjoy before and after. Plus there's often a great and friendly jazz/blues guitarist on the corner or a concert at the bar next door to enjoy. I've also been there when a DJ will spin records on the front porch. I love this place and unlike some other places downtown it's not pretentious or catering to a narrow, young and hip crowd. This is a very family friendly, date night, guilt eating and all purpose hangout spot. Check it out for the creative flavors and delicious homemade standards.",
            "Woohoo for a locally grown ice cream shoppe! I haven't had some locally made ice cream since I lived in our small college town in Northern California. After doing some shopping in the vintage shops around Roosevelt Row and sweating like crazy, my friend and I stopped by Melt. We had quite a few samples of their sorbets and ice creams including chips and salsa (with Tapatio on top). The cucumber sorbet was seriously refreshing. But I ended up with a mini-scoop of Peanut Butter. My friend also tried their Mexican Hot Chocolate and did say it was too overly spicy. Mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm creamy! This was seriously dreamy. Their ice cream, cultivated by Superstition Farms is incredibly creamy, smooth, and perfectly sweet without being too over the top. All the flavors I tried were very natural and that's a definite plus. You've got to love their scoops come in Chinese take-out boxes topped with a fortune cookie. Better yet, if you don't like your fortune, they have a jar full of them you can switch yours out with. Ha! We spotted their junk food cookies in their case on the way out and were very curious. But we asked the girl working that day (who was a bit of an awkward person who didn't listen to us very well) what was in it, but she couldn't even tell us. Ummmmm, okay? The cookie was HUGE and looked like it may have been some sort of peanut butter oatmeal concoction with potato chips and pretzels piled on top of it. I wish I would have grabbed one up to check it out. Maybe next time! My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed sitting out on their large patio area. It was a nice quiet Sunday and Roosevelt Row makes for a nice relaxing spot to sit in and admire.",
            "I was visiting from out of town and I have never had to deal with such high temperature weather before so this place definitely hit the spot on a 100 degree day. The street that Melt is on looks to have been converted from home to mini shops. Melt and other businesses around it share their buildings with another business. The storefront has picnic tables to sit on but without any trees, and it being 90+ degrees, it's difficult to enjoy your ice cream so try to go somewhere else for shade. Inside looks like a typical ice cream shop, it was pretty cramp inside so if you're a group, just make a line so it's easier for everyone. They display their ice cream in gelato tins, even placing relative toppings for the flavors like gelato shops do. You can try some samples to find your desired flavor. I ordered their Cookie Monster which was a bright blue ice cream that caught my eye instantly, it tasted like cake frosting, they place their ice cream in Chinese take out boxes and it comes with a fortune cookie. Super cute! The guy working there was super sweet and was calm the whole time, he was by himself and there was a line out the door. I applaud him for keeping his cool, I would have freaked out lol. The decor inside the store was cute and they also have free stickers! Who doesn't love free stickers? Definitely give this place a go, I heard it's fairly new so try it out before it gets even more busy!",
            "I wanted ice cream for lunch while passing through AZ and 111 degrees by noon. Phoenix was the next town so I laid my money and time down on finding The Melt. I passed by a place that looked like a bar or restaurant but figured maybe The Melt was inside? Anyway, it was a bit confusing to enter a bar type atmosphere at noon thinking \"ice cream parlor...?\" but forged forward towards the counter and there was a small ice cream case with nirvana inside. The flavors were fascinating and I settled upon Thai tea and fig/mascarpone and it was served in a take out Chinese carton with a fortune cookie on top! Fun and yes folks worth getting off the highway for! A nice gal named either Erica or Tanya (I am old and my memory is like a sieve) was quite helpful and cheery which of course was what you want when ordering ice cream. The price was a bit high for my liking (just under $8) but it really was good. So go bougie or go home when it comes to these more gourmet experiences. Hats off to you which is what happened to me next as I headed down this great street full of cool shops. I literally bought a hat. I hope you have as much flavor and shopping fun as I did by stopping in to cool off at The Melt.",
            "I've been following the Insta for so long, I randomly ended up parking near it while I was volunteering downtown, and had to try! It was tinier than I expected, but I thought it was cute! Loved all the retro candies they had on display and such. Also like that it's in an old house, and all of the shops and places surrounding it, very colorful! Being from the Midwest and hearing that they had blue moon, I had to ask because I wasn't sure. They call it smurf's blood there which I think is kinda funny haha. But it definitely brings back memories eating blue moon, which was great. They served it in little takeout containers with fortune cookies which is unique and cool. I liked the free stickers they had too haha. My friend got a watermelon sorbet, and she did not like it very much. I also tried it and wasn't a fan. The ice cream had a wonderful creamy whipped texture, and that texture just didn't work with the sorbet. I think we would have preferred if the sorbet was more dense. Overall it was a good experience, glad I went!"

            "LOVE it. DIG it. Cant get enough of it... I have so many things I like that Milk Bar makes, it's insane. I have been wanting to try Milk Bar's creations ever since I read about that famous cereal milk soft serve. It really conjured up the image of the perfect taste rooted in childhood. We all know the milk at the bottom of the cereal bowl is one of the best things in life. HA! Milk Bar is great and is open really late. I tend to stay at or near the Cosmopolitan so the walk over for some sweets is never too bad. Even if I stayed in another part of The Strip I would make my way there. I have something from Milk Bar every day of my stay. Oh yes... I do. Crack pie - DAMN YOU. You are so good and indeed made of crack. It's so good and so sweet and everything great in life. Yes. I am now a crack pie fiend. It's very sweet. Perfect to share. Cereal milk soft serve with cornflakes - YUM. Very good but not as sweet as I imagined. I guess my cereal bowls are sugar runneth over. Still tasty and yes, try it and share. Crack pie soft serve with cornflakes - SO GOOD. I actually liked this better than the cereal milk. It's sweeter. It's made from crack and crack is killin it. Get it. Thank me immediately after. You're welcome. Compost cookie - In the running for best cookie ever. So many different flavors and textures that combine to form Voltron. So delicious. It has chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, brown rice syrup, graham crackers, potato chips, flaxseed, salt, coffee, vanilla, etc... The ingredients are a long paragraph resembling a dissertation. Read it. Cornflake chocolate chip marshmallow cookies - Very good. It is a very sweet cookie. This one is not playing around. It is best shared. Corn cookie - I like it. It has great flavor and sweetness. And yes it tastes like the sweetest corn made by the Children of the Corn. Blueberry & cream cookie - What a tasty combination. I really like this cookie. My daily dose of fruit in Las Vegas. It's so good. It's perfect balance of flavors. Chocolate chocolate cookie - All the dark chocolate flavors possible on earth in one cookie. It's a little too bitter and dark chocolatey for me but you may dig it. B'day truffles - THIS is the real MVP. Dammit these 3-pack of birthday cake batter goodness in truffle form should be illegal. And yes, we took some home on the plane. Refrigeration needed. SO GOOD. Momofuku Milk Bar. Believe the hype. It did for me. Cant wait to have it again on our next trip to LV. And yes, I will have it every day. Customer service was great especially the young man from Manchester, England. It was great talking to him. Our friends & I all thought he was great... TIP THEM!",
            "Prerequisite: Watch Christina Tosi's episode on Chef's Table (Season 4, episode 1). This episode focuses on her passion for baking and how it ties in to Milk Bar, her business. She also goes into detail her inspirations behind her most well-known and beloved creations. CONCEPT: Coming from at least two generations of passionate home bakers, Christina Tosi realized that in lieu of a regular 9-5 job after college she wanted to pursue baking. She moved to NYC with inital dreams of becoming a pastry chef. While working at wd~50 she realized that she most enjoyed baking the simple desserts of her childhood becoming a pastry chef would not accomplish that goal. An introduction to Momofuku's David Chang would change her life forever as it was through this partnership her dreams would come true. Milk Bar is her dreams realized as an actual business. It became so successful that not only has it spread outside NY and lately proceeded westward, it has succeed on its own without Momofuku's influence (it eventually dropped the \"Momofuku\" part of its name in 2012). LOCATION: 2nd floor inside Cosmopolitan, literally next to Momofuku. There are four signature desserts to try at Milk Bar. 1. COOKIES - one of her favorite things to bake from childhood. Six cookie flavors and at least two gluten free/dairy cookies are available ($4) Compost: The signature cookie of her cookie line. Tosi fashioned these cookies from her favorite cookie toppings: chocolate and butterscotch chips, salted pretzels, potato chips, graham crackers and coffee grounds. What makes this cookie special are the toppings, a heavenly mixture of sweet and salty. Though they are good, compost cookies are best enjoyed when freshly made. When you buy them prepackaged they lose some of their magic because it's hard and thick. Do yourself a favor and buy the mix or learn how to make them. It's a labor of love but you'll get a much better cookie because of it AND you get to mix your own ingredients! Corn: This is actually my favorite cookie of the bunch because it tastes like cornbread as a cookie. Actually considered a cult favorite. I like this straight out of the bag. Chocolate Chocolate: A salted brownie as a cookie. Best served warm and with milk. 2. BIRTHDAY CAKE - by the 6\" whole ($55), slice ($14) or 3 truffles ($6.75). Tosi's diatribe on Chef's Table explains why this cake is made the way it is. She is much more interested in examining individual components of a cake, its textures and flavors as well as how they work as a whole. Making a cake look good by covering it with fondant or frosting is simply unnecessary as she would rather have a continuous glimpse inside. Hence when you buy birthday cake by the whole or the slice you won't see any frosting on the side and when you buy the truffles they aren't coated. The frosting is sweet and the cake is spongy. Small versions of the truffle decorate the top of the cake. If you buy a slice it lasts 1-2 days but it's best as long as the cake doesn't dry out. 3. CRACK PIE - bought as slice ($6.50) or whole ($52). This is a modern take on chess pie, a pie made for the occasion when you had almost nothing in your pantry used to make pie. She made crack pie as an accident during her stint at wd~50 making family meal. Everyone raved about this so much that they requested this every time during family meal. When Milk Bar opened she was able to serve this to a wider audience. Crack Pie is unique in the sense that it only has six major ingredients: eggs, butter, heavy cream sugar, vanilla and oat cookie, which serves as the crust. It is dense in the center due to the concentration of eggs and cream. I prefer this over a slice of Birthday Cake as it travels better (it has a smaller box if ordered individually) and there's more flavor in a single slice. It also helps that I love custard and its variants. 4. CEREAL MILK's variants. During her stint at Momofuku Ko David Chang pressured her to create a dessert to end the multi-course meal as previous dessert iterations were merely an afterthought. While on a trip to a bodega she found inspiration in a cereal aisle and used cereal milk initially on panna cotta. Chang loved it and it became a regular feature on Ko's menu. Nowadays this cereal milk can be found as soft serve (most common) or as a milkshake (personal preference) and goes especially well with cornflake topping. Didn't try the soft serve but I got to try all 3 of their shakes. There was nothing too special about cereal milk as it was almost flavorless. Birthday cake was slightly better but I prefer birthday cake as a cake. I did enjoy the chocolate malt cake as I like malt shakes. It was made even better due to the addition of the cornflake topping. As of this writing this is Milk Bar's most western outpost. Subsequent trips to Vegas I'll try to include a Milk Bar stop if at all possible.",
            "I hate going to The Strip. With the fire of a thousand suns, I hate it. I avoid it at all costs. So why then was I happily driving down Las Vegas Blvd at 3:00pm on a Friday afternoon? Milk Bar. Oh, sweet, sweet Milk Bar. Yelp Elites got a tiny little preview of the goodies at Milk Bar a couple weeks ago, and I've been wanting to pop back in to see the shop, since they weren't open for business when we had our preview. A little about Milk Bar: This is Chef Christina Tosi's 10th Milk Bar store in...8 years? (She told us at the preview, but my notes are at home.) Its the first on the West Coast. And I am SO glad that its here. Milk Bar is a little walk up storefront right across from the Chandelier Bar at the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino. Its not a coffee shop set up: there are no tables or seating, other than a small bench to wait for a shake or a quake. They have \"grab your own\" cookies laid out on the counter as you walk up to order, which was awesome. I grabbed a compost cookie and a corn cookie and made my way up to the very friendly cashier. In addition to my 2 cookies, I also ordered a crack pie to take home...to my husband. Yup. Not for me at all...really....*shifty eyes*, and a crack pie soft serve. I had to. It sounded too good to pass up. I took the baked treats home, and inhaled the soft serve on my way to the car, and in the car. Pro tip...I know it LOOKS like an ice cream cone...but you definitely want to make sure you grab a spoon from the counter. I made a pretty big mess of myself trying to get the ice cream from inside the cup without a spoon, and...yeah. Lets just say, I haven't been that messy eating ice cream since I was bout 3 years old. But it was SO. DAMNED. DELICIOUS. Seriously sweet, rich, but light at the same time...I gave myself a brain freeze twice, I couldn't eat it fast enough. When I got home, my husband and I shared the cookies. Pro tip #2: Warm them up! There is just something comforting and wonderful about a warm, chewy cookie. Husband's favorite was the compost cookie: pretzels, potato chips, coffee, oats, graham cracker, butterscotch and chocolate chips. Sweet. Salty. Wonderful. Chewy in the middle. Mmmmmmmm. The corn cookie was next, and this...this reminded me of a cross between (and this might sound REALLY weird): cornbread, and a SWEET CORN tamale. It was amazing. Sweet, chewy...I kind of wanted to put more butter on it, because that's how I eat my cornbread, but I refrained. Finally, the crack pie. It's called crack pie for a reason folks. A toasted oat crust with a gooey butter filling, it is sweet. Buttery. Delicious. The crust is light and wonderful. Milk Bar sells Christina Tosi's cookbooks, as well as sturdy canvas bags with the birthday layer cake deconstructed on it, and the softest scarves you'll ever wear. Fun little mementos. Prices aren't bad. Some items are a little spendy, but you ARE on The Strip, after all. I honestly cannot WAIT to go back to try a Fancy shake (boozy shake!). It was a little out of my price range this trip, but I will most definitely be heading back soon.",
            "As a long time Masterchef fan, I've been dying to try out the famous Milk Bar by dessert legend, Christina Tosi. Cue a long weekend trip to Vegas, offering the perfect opportunity to cross Milk Bar off my culinary bucket list. I shared a Milk Pie (formerly known as Crack Pie, but I guess that's not PC?) and Cereal Milk soft serve (with added cornflakes) with my partner. Both were fantastic. The \"Milk\" Pie (brown sugar and butter on an oat crust cookie) lived up to its former name, as it was so darn delicious. It offered every flavor and texture I'm looking for in a dessert. Sweet, buttery, salty, sticky, gooey, and simply delicious. Be warned that this is a very rich, sweet dessert. If I wasn't already in dessert heaven with my Milk Pie, my Cereal Milk soft serve brought me there for sure. I loved how the soft serve really did taste like cereal milk; like the sweet milk you drink after the frosted coasting on your cereal disintegrates into your milk. However, it wasn't overly sweet and the soft serve had a nice, mellow sweet flavor. The cornflakes were essential in adding a much needed textural element to compliment the creaminess of the soft serve. I wish there was a Milk Bar by me so I could always treat myself to one of Christina Tosi's fantastic creations. Not only is Milk Bar super cute and #grammable, but also outright delicious. I suppose my body...and wallet, for that matter, are happy that it requires a plane ride for me to get a treat at Milk Bar. If not, you'd find me here on the regular!",
            "I've been to New York before but unfortunately didn't have enough time to try Milk Bar. I've heard only good things about this place so I was excited to try it. Luckily I was able to try their birthday cake truffles and their soft serve while dining at Momofuku in January. Both were really good. So I'm glad Milk Bar is open next door to satisfy my sweet tooth. Came here in January before my flight back home to get some cookies. The worker described all the cookies to me and when she said the blueberry and cream cookies tasted like a blueberry muffin, I was sold. I grabbed a couple of those and then a corn cookie, compost cookie, and a chocolate chip with marshmellow cookie. I definitely liked the blueberry cookie the best. The are a little pricey but I think it's worth it. I came back again in April and bought some more cookies. All blueberry and Chocolate chip. Those two, in my opinion, are the best. I also got myself a cereal and fruity pebbles twist soft serve with cereal crunch. The cereal crunch has some kind of saltiness to it that balances out the sweetness. It's really pleasant. FYI, I bought ice cream here at 10am. It's never too early to satisfy your sweet tooth. Also, you're on vacation. Live a little. haha Milk bar and their treats are really good. So good, that I had my friend, who lives in Vegas, bring me some cookies back to the bay when she came home to visit. The staff is really friendly and knowledgeable about the products. Both times I've come here there was no line which is great. I'm addicted. The cookies (and their soft serve) are divine. They're so good and I can't wait to get some more when I visit Vegas again in September! Do yourself a favor and pick some of these bad boys up, you won't regret it."

            "Cleveland is so lucky to have Mitchell's. I think we sometimes take it for granted because we are used to seeing it in the grocery store, but truly, whenever I visit this flagship location, I'm reminded how awesome it is. This is a great place to bring an out-of-town guest. Oh, Mitchell's, how do I love thee, let me count the ways... + Fresh ice cream. Keyword: FRESH. Ice cream has a big difference when it's made with fresh ingredients. My absolute favorite is the key lime pie-- it's a crumbly, tart delicious batch of goodness. All the flavors are f-a-n-t-a-s-t-i-c. Salted caramel and chocolate covered pretzel are my other favorites, depending on mood. + Non-dairy and vegan options (I know nothing about this life, but pretty cool that they offer it, right?) + Accessible grab-and-go pints if you feel like pretending something is for your \"boyfriend\" but really you just want more ice cream for yourself for later. + Two floors of handicap accessible seating!! You can take the elevator or stairs to the second floor and enjoy a totally spacious alternative seating area. + You can watch ice cream being made! They have a huge glass wall that can be observed on either the bottom or top floor. It can be very entertaining for little ones to watch the big machines at work through a 2-story viewing glass. The staff at Mitchell's is also super helpful and they handle long lines like champions, even when people are being super difficult. I also appreciate that Mitchell's is involved in the community. I see their name attached to community initiatives all the time. For me, I love a business even more when giving back to their community is a core part of their values.",
            "Some of the best ice cream we've ever had nationwide and at prices that we hadn't seen in years! After a trip to the West Side Market, my wife and I swung by Mitchell's on a warm summer Saturday afternoon at 12pm, which seemed like the perfect timing. The ice cream shop had just opened 30 minutes prior and there weren't many people inside, so we took our time exploring the menu and flavors. From the moment people spot Mitchell's you can tell it's just different. For one, the outside looks like the entrance to a movie theater. Once customers make their way in, they're greeted by a huge glass window straight ahead where you can see into their ice cream making facility. However, what customers really need to focus on is the writing and menu on the glass window, which is not only written in a light white, but incredibly hard to see. I won't dock them any stars for that snafu, but maybe making it a bit darker would have helped, however I get that they want to showcase the factory behind the glass. Anyway, we surveyed the flavors at the ordering counter and the options. We tend to make the mistake of over-ordering, but also what to try as much as we can, so what better option than the Taster's Duo, which is supposed to be a single scoop of 2 different flavors. After being enlightened by the very helpful employees there about their most popular and favorite flavors, my wife ordered the Strawberry Rhubard and Fresh Peach on a sugar cone, while I ordered the Toasted Pistachio and Caramel Fudge Brownie, with the latter supposedly being their most in demand flavor. The verdict? EXCELLENT. The ice cream wasn't too soft and had very good texture to it. The flavors were really good and we loved each and every bite. The Strawberry Rhubard and Fresh Peach were fruity, but savory. The Toasted Pistachio and Caramel Fudge Brownie were sweet, but not overpowering. The Caramel Fudge Brownie had large chunks of brownie inside of the ice cream, which I loved. Overall, the ice cream was delicious and perfect. What was even better was how generous the scoops were. We ordered the Taster's Duo, which was supposed to be 2 half scoops, but when we received our cones, the ice cream was overloaded. It looked like they had given us 2 gigantic single scoops of each flavor we ordered. In addition, the Taster's Duo was just $3.95, which is unheard of these days for ice cream from a shop. I guess we felt we really got our money's worth too because we basically got 2 scoops instead of one. We loved the price point here, but we loved the flavors, serving size and delicious ice cream even more.",
            "How come all those boxes in the kitchen say \"Baskin Robbins?\" I kid!! I've always loved Mitchell's ice cream, and now we finally have one in Ohio City! The kitchen is not up and running yet, but you can at least view the massive space from the various viewing windows. They even have some art posted in the upstairs. Pro-tip: If you're going upstairs, don't bother with elevator unless you can't do stairs. The elevator is super slow. At any rate, the art isn't my cup of tea, but it's worth a view since my opinions are like butt holes. The ice cream is, of course, the main attraction. They have a huge selection of flavors and, if you're really unsure of yourself, you can try all of them. I tested their patience by tasting a ton of flavors and they didn't even flinch. Every flavor was full of awesome, except for the salted caramel (blasphemy, I know). That flavor always tasted burnt to me. The chocolate salted caramel, on the other hand, tasted great!. I ultimately got two scoops of a peanut butter fudge ice cream flavor in a waffle cone (hell yeah!) while my buddy got a fancy sundae. Both were awesome. Overall, service is super good--everyone is really friendly and happy. It's kind of like the service at a hateful chicken (that's Chick-fil-A), but without those scary forced smiles. These folks seem genuinely happy with the job and it shows. There's a few tables for eating in-house. If it's packed, you may have to sit with some folks you don't know. And that's kind of the appeal. Overall, I'm a fan. This is surely going to cause a rift between Ohio City and Gordon Square when fans of Sweet Moses riot against the fans of the new Mitchell's. Both are great, but expect this to be the spark that sets off a massive battle pitting ice cream lover against ice cream lover, brother against brother. I'm told that one day, someone will get a scoop from each place in the same bowl, and peace will be restored.",
            "Initial side note: Mitchell's Ice Cream can't be compared to East Coast Custard. They are two completely different frozen deserts. Ice cream as we know it is primarily made with more air and more cream (fat content), while custard has a significantly higher egg yolk content and less air. It's like comparing red grapes to green grapes. Yes, they're both frozen desserts, but significant variations exist between the two. As a second side note, gelato is has lower fat content than ice cream and has less air. My first time I was in a Mitchell's Ice Cream was on the CWRU campus. The first thing I said to myself was, \"Huh. They sell dry ice. THAT'S AWESOME.\" But it's funny. After I left Cleveland 7 years ago (not at my own volition, to be honest), the city decided to get good, and it's been getting better ever since. And when I started to visit the West side, I finally realized that that's where all the real gems really are in the city. But I digress. That's not what this review is about. It's really about the ice cream. It's funny how ice cream is. You grow up eating the crummy store brand ice cream, since it's the cheapest, then the not as cheap brands (like Edy's and Breyers) full of not-so-straightforward elmulsifiers, then you go to college and start growing up and you try the better national brands, like Ben and Jerry's, UDF, Haagen Dazs (of which the latter is way too sweet, by the way). Then you start trying out local stuff. That, my friends is where the fun starts. At least in Ohio. In Cincinnati, you have Graeter's Ice Cream. It's made by the \"French pot process\" but the flavors are pretty conservative and traditional, but they do it well. Then you have Columbus' Jeni's Ice Cream where they make adventurous flavors you never thought would ever go together work, requiring nerves of steel to order their favors, but it's more of a boutique ice cream parlor (lighter, pricier, and smaller portions). Mitchell's hits that awesome sweet spot in the middle. Not only does it do traditional flavors well (and better than Sweet Moses, IMHO). Their ice creams don't skimp on flavor or ingredients. This is especially so with their seasonal flavors (and specialty flavors), which elevate these folks to a whole to a whole new and phenomenal level. When they have seasonal fruit flavors, they use actual fruit in the ice cream, and you can see it being be put in the ice cream as they make it behind the service area. You see them open boxes of chocolates with stickers that say \"Product of Belgium\". Lavender honey ice cream tastes like honey (and lavender) (though some may find it a bit too sweet) . You want s'mores in your ice cream? No problem, you'll find milk chocolate, graham cracker crumble, and marshmellow fluff. Then you have porter dark chocolate. Yes. Great Lakes Brewery's very own Edmund Fitzgerald Porter in ice cream form with dark chocolate chunks. Really, you can't go wrong with any their flavors, and they give generous portions. If your brain stops working at being able to choose from the the easily 20+ flavor offerings at any one day, the staff is more than eager to let you try the flavors. Remember that dry ice I mentioned earlier? It's to throw into coolers so out-of-towners can take the ice cream home with them, never melted and refrozen. And I would totally do that if I had a cooler (which I don't), when I would return to Cincinnati. In all honesty, they've become the ice cream standard in Cleveland, and to the Cincinnatian who worried about ice cream cred in his review: Your cred is intact. Mitchell's is indeed better than Graeter's. As a warning, the W 25th St. location doesn't have straightforward parking -- it's street parking immediately around the parlor. It's a very busy area with restaurants and bars. So, parking there may be a challenge.",
            "I feel I should give a disclaimer before diving into this review: Mitchell's might steal a little piece of your soul. You might walk through the doors under its stylish theater sign and emerge from the store a changed person. You might hunch over every bowl of ice cream for the rest of your life and sigh because it's not the same. If you're okay with this, read on. Walking into this Mitchell's store is kind of like walking into a real-life, less terrifying version of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, because there are huge windows behind the counter that let you see into the kitchen. There's also a miniature train that does laps around the ceiling of the store. It's shiny and bright inside, with high ceilings and plenty of seating (though this may fill up at busier times). I mean, it could just be my great love of ice cream, but this place feels magical to me. The employees here truly deserve a special mention, because they're always outstanding. I've been here many times (despite living ~40 minutes away) and I've never had a bad experience with service. Everyone behind the counter is always smiling, and they'll gladly give offer you samples. They're friendly and pretty fast no matter how busy it is (and it does get busy). I always make sure to throw a few dollars in the tip jar. Mitchell's ice cream is made from a lot of ingredients sourced locally or from farmers who use sustainable practices (for coffee, vanilla beans, etc), which I think is admirable. Also, it is freaking delicious, and you really can't go wrong with any flavor (of which there are many). You'll be happy whether you want a high-quality version of something traditional, or something with a little more pizazz. The roughly $3 - $5 you'll pay for a serving is well worth it to me, and their portions are quite generous. They also have vegan flavors, smoothies, frozen yogurt, and sorbet! Favorite flavors: Caramel Fudge Brownie - Vanilla ice cream jam packed with delicious brownie chunks and a ribbon of creamy caramel. It's evident here that Mitchell's does not mess around with their add-ins. Cookie Dough - See above. I've spent a good portion of my life on an epic quest for chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream that actually has adequate amounts of chocolate chips AND cookie dough, and this does. No need to waste your time sifting through plain vanilla ice cream on the off-chance of finding a chunk of dough, because with this you get some IN EVERY BITE. I wish I were eating this now. Fresh Mint Chocolate Chunk - What can I say? I like the classics. Real mint, real chocolate, no artificial green color. Enough said. Peanut Butter Chocolate Pretzel - Peanut butter frozen yogurt with little chocolate covered pretzel bites. Technically not ice cream, but still a perfectly good choice. I mean, what else can I say? You should go to Mitchell's. But you probably already figured that out."

            "We finally took the endeavor to the Boardwalk to try Ninety's. I love the concept of this place: sandwiches and novelty ice cream stuff. First, for a Sunday evening, I was shocked at how packed it was- the line was out the door. Wasn't sure if this was a staffing issue or if t just took forever to make the orders. The line moved at an ok pace. Second of all, and I feel like this was glaring... THEY WERE NOT PLAYING ANY 90s MUSIC!!!! Also no 90s decor whatsoever. For a #beninetiescool they kind of drop the ball on that. The sandwich menu (which should be placed on the incoming side of the line instead of the far end) were all 90s themed names, so they committed there. But I'm not sure why that was the extent of the theme. The rest of the decor was lacking too. They had valentine's day decorations up which was nice. But low tile ceiling and tile floors made it feel cramped. As far as the actual food... - Reuben: not too bad. Nice and warm, great thousand island sauce. - Ice cream shake: got the choco lotta coconut. Was hoping it would have more of the caramel, coconut and shortbread cookies mixed in. Also, the ice cream was Hershey's. I'm not against it, but it was just average. - Yummee Buns: okay these were DELICIOUS. Perfect hunny buns, and the perfect amount of toppings and ice cream. These are basically ice cream sandwiches with a hunny bun as the outer part. We got the OG (vanilla with strawberry shortcake spread and sprinkles) and the peanut butter chocolate one with chocolate ice cream and Reese's. Both delicious!!! - Ice cream macaroons: also pretty good. The macaroons were perfect. Again I wish the ice cream was a little better than Hershey's, but the toppings were nice. I didn't get these, but I did have a bite. So 3 stars due to long line and lack of decor (really selling themselves short on this- could be an easy fix). The sandwiches were pretty good, and the desserts were good, but had a little to be desired. I would definitely drive up there again just for a Yummee Bun again though!!!",
            "We rushed into Ninety's Ice Cream & Sandwich late at night when we had a sweet tooth craving. It's like the desert heavens blessed us with its sweet goodness! We did not want to interrupt their restaurant closing routine, but I did not want to deny myself the delicious treat. They were still inviting as I'm sure we would be their last customers for the evening. We learned they'd undergone renovation and rebranded their sweet spot. They took the initiative to show us the process of how they create their yummy Strawberry Shortcake Shake. The first sip/scoop of the yummy shake with shortbread crumbs was [insert bright warm lights here] delicious. Perfect for a sweet tooth who loves strawberry shortcake!",
            "Weight watchers beware, this place is simply full of sweets and fattening ice cream sandwiches! You have to admit though that it's a good idea to Treat Yo'self every once in awhile. For those occasions where only delicious desserts will satisfy, I couldn't recommend Ninety's enough! If you're familiar with the boardwalk in the university area then you probably already know where it's at. Park on the side closest to the Light Rail and look for the Chinese restaurant, it's across the walk from there. While there's not much to talk of concerning the decor, it is very clean and there's a bit of seating for people looking to beat the heat. It seems that they're banking on most enjoying their treats on the boardwalk, the rest of the building quickly fills up with excited families and individuals alike wanting a delicious snack. So as far as the treats, what tickles your fancy? They have macaron ice cream sandwiches, ice cream filled doughnuts, ice cream cake pops, all kinds of desserts. You can also get your ice cream in a cup or cone, but why would you? The couple of macaron ice cream sandwiches I've gotten here were outstanding and well thought out. They offer different flavors of macarons paired with specific ice creams and toppings. The team even seems to have a thing for cereals, and incorporates them into a lot of their products! I have to admit, I didn't expect the macarons themselves to be such a high quality product since they're being used in ice cream sandwiches, but I'd say these were excellent macarons. They could even stand on their own with a traditional filling if they chose to do so. Maybe something to consider! I'd love give 'em the perfect score, but last time they were out of a LOT of the specials. They were very accommodating with substitutes, for example they were out of the samoa macaron and just did a regular vanilla on my sandwich. My girlfriend also wanted the coffee ice cream sandwich and they were out of its 'biscotti' macaron so she had to settle for a substitute as well. All in all it they were out of 3 macarons, and 2 ice creams. So I hope that next time I'm able to try some of their named creations as they intended. Still, a very good package either way. Not a gimmick, and still going strong. Way to rock, Ninety's!",
            "So glad this was my intro to Charlotte. Been to the city before but not as a foodie, so was delighted to get this sweet first treat. After doing some research I found I had to stop at this place for a delicious and Instagram worthy snack. I wasn't disappointed. Staff was friendly attentive and caterered to my food blogger tendencies. It was busy which is always a good sign and decorated for St. Patrick's - I like it when food establishments acknowledge stuff like that. More so when it is reflected in the menu. Definitely try their macaroon ice cream sandwiches. Delicious! I would also recommend a getting one of their signature cookie dough pops. Don't really eat edible cookie dough often, but the ones they serve had me wanting another. Next time I want a milkshake, they look amazing too.",
            "My husband and I love Ninety's for a sweet treat. It is definitely indulgent if you get a yum-ee bun, but so worth it! The bun is like a donut and they warm it with your ice cream inside. I'm not sure how the bun is so warm and the ice cream is still so cold, but it's amazing! My husband gets the Oreo milkshake, and he loves it! Everything at Ninety's is just a little extra special. Also, the dark chocolate hazelnut ice cream is so good. Like, heavenly good."

            "What a novel concept! (Pun intended.) And I'm not just talking about the interesting flavors, such as the honey Sriracha (hippy, I know, but keep an opened mind and read on), Novel has to offer but the enthusiasm and genuine human kindness from the staff. Tucked in a little house on a cul-de-sac of eateries, Novel is cute and homey and is a rather small ice cream parlor, but good things can come in small packages (or at least some good things...) As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by very friendly people who were more than happy to let us try whatever we want. Now I am a traditionalist when it comes to ice cream and sweets but I am not going to turn down trying \"honey sriracha\". My theory was \"I like honey and I like sriracha; I should try it!\" Well, let's just say I was glad I tried it because now I don't have to try it again anymore! It was definitely not bad and very interesting, but I learned that I prefer my ice cream to be sweet and non-spicy. I also tried the honey lavender and it was the perfect balance of honey and lavender, which I think is pretty difficult to achieve due to the two flavors being relatively mellow on its own. Nevertheless, I cannot eat a whole scoop of honey lavender just because it's too avant-garde for me. But butter pecan? That I can do a whole scoop, and then some. Saw it, tried it, loved it, getting it. I know butter pecan belongs to the lackluster ice cream flavors category, but this is probably by far the best butter pecan ice cream I've ever had. My partner had the donut ice cream sandwich and I had a bite. I must admit it was much better than I had anticipated. In fact, I wouldn't have mind if I had a donut sandwich for myself. The donut tasted fresh and soft without being too sweet. The ice cream in the donut was some sort of peanut butter and banana. It had some crunchy graham cracker/cereal as well, but I forget what it was. Everything combined together was a match well made. The patio outside has tables and chairs and is lit with Christmas lights. The ambiance is relaxing and lovely. All in all, I would normally avoid places that serve \"hand-crafted artisan ice cream\" just because of the stigma that usually come with that kind of labeling but I am glad I tried Novel and the interesting ice cream flavors and met the friendly crew. And if you haven't tried this place, I'd say it'd be a novel thing to do to give it a whirl.",
            "The owner, Brandon, invited me back for a second visit, after I left a review not being a fan of the Fat Elvis flavor. He explained that it is a very polarizing flavor, love or hate. He also said that customers can ask to try every and any flavor! Feel free to ask for a sample of every flavor, no judgement! He wants his establishment to be different than some other ice cream shops that act like it's a burden to sample more than 1 flavor. Their menu has some flavors that stay every day, and some that rotate, so each time you go there will be different flavors to try. Today I tried 6 flavors: Straight Up Strawberry: the best plain strawberry ice cream I've ever had. I'm not usually a fruity ice cream type of person, but I wanted to venture out. Worth it! Very fresh Lemon Blueberry Sorbet: not a big sorbet fan, but this was amazing. Very tangy and sweet at the same time. Tasted like a frozen lemonade. Very soft, the spoon goes right through it. Bourbon Caramel Toffee Crunch: this is a great choice is you want something with texture. The bourbon and caramel makes a great sweet but interesting flavor. This one is worth a sample at least, some may not like the bourbon but I do! Honey Lavender: one of my top 2! I just love honey lavender, and it's a hard flavor to get right. This one tasted very natural. Floral and sweet perfection. Sweet Cream and Honey: very subtle sweetness. This one would probably be loved by EVERYONE! Thai Tea: one of my top 2! Thai tea ice cream is rare to find and I've only seen it a few times. This one was so amazing. They source real authentic tea leaves and use it in their ice cream, you can see the leaves in the ice cream. No artificial flavors here. This one is definitely a love it or hate it flavor, but it's my favorite! It tastes just like a Thai tea drink, but in solid form. Brandon is a great business owner and really cares about the experience. He uses REAL INGREDIENTS and many are sourced locally. If you ever have a bad experience here feel free to reach out to him, he will make it right! Im now a huge fan of this establishment. The customer service from every employee I met was amazing. The ice cream is award winning, their ice cream chef competes in ice cream convention competitions! No wonder this place is 5/5.",
            "Hands down the best strawberry ice cream I've ever had in my life. I'm new to the Phoenix area, but I have a hard time imagining going anywhere else for ice cream now that I've found Novel. This little ice cream shop is located on the outskirts of downtown Phoenix, within a small cluster of independently owned shops with their own small parking lot and plenty of street parking. The owners, Brandon and Jennifer, are incredibly warm and humble hosts, and it's clear that they have a genuine passion for hand making ice cream and crafting unique flavors. Upon walking in, we were greeted with kind smiles and genuine care. Brandon told us that at any given time, they have eight ice cream flavors, half of which are standard and then other half that rotate depending on ingredients and what they dream up (and are their imaginations impressive). Samples are generously offered and even encouraged, and it was difficult to choose between all the impressive flavors. On the particular day I went, the flavors included honey lavender, butter pecan, strawberry, peach, fat elvis (peanut butter, banana, and bacon bits), cookie monster (cookies and cream with blue food coloring -- a favorite for kids, I'm sure), and more! They also offer donut ice cream sandwiches, which are toasty on the outside and refreshing on the inside. A variety of cones are available as well, and though I was tempted to add on a waffle cone, I opted for a double scoop because I couldn't resist the amazing flavors. Strawberry with real ripe strawberries churned in: Seemingly simple, this strawberry ice cream literally made me want to buy a tub of it and eat it all by myself. Brandon let us know that they churn in fresh ripe strawberries before freezing, which gives the ice cream a fragrant taste of summer and is like no strawberry ice cream I've ever had before. Strawberry is my favorite flavor in general, but I've yet to have a strawberry-flavored anything that was as balanced as this ice cream. The fruitiness offered an refreshing sweetness to the creaminess, which kept the ice cream from being too sweet or too rich -- hence the desire to never stop eating it. Honey lavender with real lavender buds: If I'm ever in the mood for a slightly sweeter, more floral flavor, this honey lavender would be my first choice. I was impressed with the use of real lavender buds, which gives a surprisingly potent pop of lavender every time I came across one. I loved it -- but be warned if you're not a fan of floral flavors: it's very strong. Fat Elvis: This flavor naming made me laugh, and it was an interesting blend of peanut butter, banana, and bacon bits. The bacon is very subtle, but the bacon bits give a nice pop of saltiness in contrast to the peanut butter and banana in every bite. I'm not a huge fan of banana or bacon, but I could tell this flavor was made really well with the intention of balancing saltiness and sweetness, and my other couldn't get enough. Cookie Monster: This is a huge hit with the kids, I bet, and it's the only flavor that had anything artificial churned in (blue food coloring). This cookies and cream wasn't overly sweet, and it had the added fun of turning your tongue blue! I think it's sweet that the owners considered putting in a flavor that was attractive to kids, and it just goes to show the care and thoughtfulness they put into their work. I'm missing that strawberry ice cream just writing this review, and I can't wait to go back soon.",
            "Best ice cream in town.......check. Amazing house made glazed donuts.....check. Wonderful owners....check. Lots of tasty toppings....check Put this all together and this hidden gem is going to be a favorite of mine and for ANY who gives it a try. After enjoying Father's Day with my great dad and entire family, I recommended we all try out Novel Ice Cream as my dad loves a cold treat. Who doesn't? With that said, we all (9) showed up at Novel and I must admit I was concerned. As us yelpers know, when you recommend a spot blindly you just hope your thoughts of the establishment are right on and thank the Lord, Novel Ice Cream was a huge hit. Upon entering, the owners (Brandon and Jennifer) were so darn friendly. Brandon gave us all the rundown and offered everyone as many tasting as needed in making our selections. It took me no time at all as I knew the Fat Elvis (PB, banana, and bacon) was the one for me. Okay, I can't lie, I had a scoop of the lavender and honey as well. Both amazing. After everyone received their ice cream, we headed outside to the patio (no seating inside) to enjoy our dessert. As I have already said, best dang ice cream not only have I ever had but my family too. Like my entire family!!!!! Mind you my father who is 70+ and considers himself a connoisseur of amazing ice cream kept telling me that it was the best ice cream he has ever eaten. He also continued to tell me what a great job I did at finding the place. Almost made me feel like a played a part in making the amazing stuff. Upon finishing my sweet treat and having to do my yelper job, I tried others treats as well. The glazed donut (nice and warm) with ice cream (Cookie Monster) slammed in the middle was awesome. The pistachio ice cream was the best I have had and I have tried a lot. Everything here was just great. Overall, this gem is a winner and you better hit the place up before everyone else knows about it. There is not a better joint in town for ice cream and better people serving it.",
            "Novel Ice Cream is, in a single word, delicious. Read on to hear see the rest of the story, but the short version is this: this is incredible ice cream; personally served by a gracious and knowledgeable owner. Each flavor is unique and everything tasted delicious. I would go all in and get the ice cream served on the donut for a truly spectacular experience. Arizona during the summer gets hot and nothing beats a cool scoop of ice cream. As such, I am always on the hunt for new and interesting places to get a frozen scoop of deliciousness. A quick Google of best ice cream shops in Arizona revealed to my friend and I that Novel was not just one of the best ice creams in Arizona, but very likely, the best ice cream in the U.S. We had to try it. When we arrived Saturday evening there was already the start of a line. Given all the accolades this physically small (maybe a few hundred square feet) ice cream shop was getting a line was expected. However, do not despair, the line moves quickly, the people are friendly, and the entire time anticipation builds for what was going to be a delicious scoop (or two). When it was our turn in line, we found the owner personally scooping ice cream for customers. He greeted each one of us, was incredibly gracious, and was extremely knowledgeable about this product. \"Our bacon comes from here...this is a 16% butterfat mixture...our donuts are created specifically for us to create these sandwiches.\" He encouraged us to try different flavor options. Even though there was a line out the door, the owner took time to make conversation and introduced himself personally (as did my friends and I). I chose the Burbon coffee toffee and the bright blue cookie monster. Once we received our dessert my friends and I went outside and started tasting. It was more delicious then we could have imagined. Incredible flavor and texture the perfect treat for a hot summers evening. I will be back!"

            "Oberweis brings in some hefty competition competition to the Chambana ice cream scene. Being a chain store, Oberweis has many locations throughout the Chicagoland area, some of which I've visited in the past. While the milk is good, the ice cream and shakes here are better. In fact, there is only one thing I consistently order at any Oberweis: the ice cream shake. The whip cream with the Oberweis milk and ice cream all combine to make a delicious and amazing dessert. Every shake gets topped off with a piroutte chocolate hazelnut wafer stick, which is fun. I have nothing against the other items on their menu but the shakes here are my go-to item. My only complaint would be the pricing could be a bit better, especially considering the ice cream shops in town. On my visit here, I got a caramel shake, which was great and tasted on par to what I've previously had at other locations. The service was a bit slow as there was only one person at the counter taking orders for a pretty big line; however, there was minimal wait in getting the shake after placing the order. It was nice to see that they've kept the tradition of having some tables where you can play chess, though it always seemed a bit of a sticky situation with the sweet milky desserts around as you played. While I think it will be hard for Oberweis to beat the other local ice cream favorites, they offer many delicious ice cream related desserts and add a nice variety of options to the other ice cream and dairy options in town.",
            "The place is clean and the staff were friendly. But: we waited for 15 minuets to get our order, and they were not even making ice creams to order as Jarlings does. I got the chocolate almond coconut and my friend got their lemon blackberry special. Mine was half melted when I got it! My friend's seemed better, but overly sweet! It seemed like they have mixed overly sweet blackberry jam with overly sweet lemon ice cream. It wasn't lemony and refreshing at all. We barely finished our expensive melted and overly sweet ice creams and left. Never going back.",
            "Today was our first ever visit to Oberweis and we loved it! My husband ordered cinnamon hot cocoa and we shared a peanut butter chocolate sundae. The sundae came with peanut butter chocolate ice cream in a chocolate dipped waffle bowl topped with chopped peanut butter cup and hot fudge. Yum! (They were out of the peanut butter sauce this dish usually comes with it, but we were advised it would be even better with hot fudge.) It was fantastic and I'm still thinking about it! We hope to return soon to pick up an ice cream cake or pie, a quart of ice cream, or some chocolate milk. The employees were friendly and this location was clean and inviting. Highly recommend!",
            "Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! I ordered a brownie a la mode with the espresso chip ice cream, and it was absolutely fabulous! If I lived in Champaign, I would be back at least once a week! My son had chocolate ice cream in a sprinkle cone, and also loved it! What a nice treat to happen upon this delightful ice cream oasis in the parking lot of our hotel!",
            "Trying out a scoop of ice cream after a bit so great lunch at the burger place next door. Husband and I both got single scoops in waffle cones, total was $11 and some change. A bit pricey for some ice cream. They have several different flavors of ice cream, you can get a banana split, sundaes, shakes, malts, slice of cake, cold drinks and hot drinks. You can purchase bottles of milk and ice cream also. Got our ice cream, he got plain vanilla it's good, but vanilla is so plain and ordinary haha I got the lemon blackberry and it's delicious! So much sweet flavor. The ice cream is good and very creamy. Although the price is a little more than some other places in the area, I think we will return here every once in awhile"

            "I'm so glad that I found this place last year! It's a PGH classic but if you don't know about it then you're missing out. Tucked away on an unassuming street in South Side, this little dairy mart knows its way around ice cream. It's always worth the drive and usual long wait in the line. Never disappoints. I have only gone at peak hours on weekends during which times we have waited sometimes close to an hour to order. But honestly, on a nice night out, I don't mind hanging out and chatting with friends while we're waiting to order. Once you order the food comes out super quickly. The non-ice cream food is just so-so but if you're hungry for something savory to complement your dairy dessert, it'll hit that spot for sure. The ice cream. Wow. So so good. As someone who eats probably way too much ice cream, I can honestly say that this place is one of the best. No matter what you order, it will be good. The arctic freezes easily beat out the classic Blizzard from Dairy Queen. Thicker, creamier, and more flavor options. The sundaes are huge - definitely split with someone if you're not up for the task of consuming the whole thing. The soft serve is delicious and the number of topping options is really impressive. Will definitely be coming here more as the summer heats up to try the other things on the menu. Note that parking can be pretty chaotic. You kind of just have to pull in and haphazardly find a spot to park (and probably eat your ice cream). There isn't any seating outside the place and there is no inside space. It's part of the charm in my opinion but definitely can see how it could be stressful if you have kiddos with you. Make sure to be prepared to eat in the car and grab some extra napkins for any spills!",
            "Have been wanting to trying this place for a while! Came on a Thursday night and there was a pretty long line, but it moves quickly. Luckily we found a parking spot. I got the Nancy B Chocolate Fudge Sundae! Wow, was it huge! The chocolate chip cookie was nice and warm and they did not skimp on the fudge. I truly enjoyed every bite! They have so many options to choose from, so I know I will definitely be back. My friend got an arctic swirl and enjoyed it as well. Their portions are huge, so come hungry! Overall, a great place to satisfy your sweet tooth craving! Prices are super reasonable as well!",
            "It doesn't get much more Pittsburgh classic than Page's! I fondly remember driving past Page's on the drive into Bloomfield to see my grandparents, into Oakland to return back to Pitt, into the South Side to go shopping with friends...the list goes on and on. Now that I am no longer a Pittsburgh resident, I think back to those memories and when I do drive past Page's during trips home, I know a stop is in order. During my most recent visit this past weekend, my also out-of-towner sister and current Pittsburgh resident parents all embarked on that Page's trip, because truly, who turns down ice cream?! It was an unseasonably warm March weekend, so many people had the same idea as us, but the long line went by really quickly, and luckily, all our ice cream choices were still well-stocked. My favorite thing at Page's is the number of soft serve options, so I had to go with that. I was so happy to see birthday cake soft serve on the menu, so I jumped on that in a cake cone. For just shy of $3, you get a perfectly sized portion that hits your sweet tooth but doesn't make you feel totally gross for indulging. The birthday cake also wasn't sickeningly sweet, as I've had in other desserts, and it was chockfull of sprinkles. This was definitely one of the best soft serves I've had in a long time! My sister and mom loved their toasted coconut soft serve, and my dad was a big fan of his black raspberry dish as well. Page's is always a crowd pleaser, and we love being able to try something new every time. While I do have a soft spot for the soft serve, the sundaes are second to none as well, and should definitely be considered during any visit! Thank you for allowing me to reminisce on my childhood memories and for being a constant during my visits back to ever-changing Pittsburgh - can't wait to visit again!",
            "Ok, ok, ok, ok, I know, I know, that was naughty. But it was oh sooooooooooooooooooo Good! We split a medium turtle sundae. It is just your average soft serve ice cream. What makes them truly fabulous is the whole package. The turtle had the most wonderful slightly warm toasted salted pecans and plenty of them. The sundae was perfectly put together such that I was able to have toppings in every bite. The medium size was plenty big enough for us to split and feel satisfied with our naughtiness. You can park under the overpass which is actually super cool looking and oddly urban romantic. Prices are exactly where you want them, family spending friendly. I love this place!",
            "Pittsburgh's hidden gem! I lived here for 3 year before I even heard about this place. On the far far end of South Side (toward Homestead) sits Page Dairy Mart. One might be skeptical about stopping in after seeing its location on the side of a road, under a bridge, across from a train track but trust me - it is SO worth it. Honestly, the long line that weaves through the parking lot should be a dead giveaway about how good it is. Don't let the line steer you away either! It tends to move very quickly and the ice cream is worth the wait. The ONLY downside to Page's is there isn't really a seating area so you tend to either have to stand around to enjoy your treat or eat it in your car. But again, worth it. The menu is overwhelming large (a good problem to have) with your choices of milkshakes, arctic swirls, ice cream sandwiches, so many types of cones...the list goes on. (They also have food like fries, hot dogs, etc. but back to the ice cream). You can get something so decadent and sweet like an Yinzer sundae or something so simple and classic like a soft serve cone. It's some of the best soft serve in the 'burgh. I do have a roommate that is dairy sensitive and they don't have many options for that (I think just slushies/snow cones) but, for any one else, the world is your oyster at Page's. You can choose any item off the menu or come up with your own creation. I come from a small town where little, locally run ice cream shops thrive and this place just feels like home. If you're coming to visit Pittsburgh, I would honestly recommend coming here before some of the other \"Pittsburgh classics\"."

            "Came into town for the weekend and popped in for dessert after dinner. Cute spot near U of I campus. Ambience: Paris theme, inside there are some table and couches with cubes chairs. There are some games upfront if you want hang out for a bit. Connect Four, Uno, Jenga. Food: great options for rolled ice cream, either get it in a cup or in a waffle taco. Or you can get a scoop of ice cream in a crepe that holds other flavors like Nutella or chocolate. Our friends had the rolled ice cream and crepes. I'd recommend the coffee addict, so good! Hope I can try a crepe next time. They also have some fries snacks like tater tots and lattice chips. Drinks: you need to try these cute lightbulb drinks. We had the honey lemonade and I got to try the sparkling blueberry mojito. Both were awesome! And the lightbulb is too cool to pass up on. Staff: Efficient and friendly. Fun to watch them make the crepes and rolled ice cream while you watch! Owners are great, they happened to be the staff for the night. Overall, awesome spot and we'll be back when we're in town again. Price: $4.95-$7.60, snacks run about $3.00. Good deal for what you get.",
            "This place is new and currently has soft opening but still the service was efficient. The staff is nice. During the soft opening time period, this restaurant is offering 20% off on all the menu items. I ordered Takoyaki and coffee addict Thai ice cream with toppings of marshmallow and macaron. Takoyaki tasted good and the ice cream had a strong kick of coffee. If You love coffee, you will definitely like this flavor. Macaron was yum too. Overall, both the items tasted good. They also have board games and cards. So you can enjoy appetizers and games with your friends. Next time I will surely try their crepes.",
            "We came here for dessert after eating chinese nearby. The place is very cozy with some high chair and sofa seating. As soon as you walk in, you can smell the deliciousness. There's soft techno-type music playing in the background but not too loud where you have to yell to have a conversation. We ordered the banana nutella crepe and the signature crepe to share. The banana nutella was very sweet and I'm glad I was sharing it because it was way too sweet to eat alone. The signature was very good and that one I had the opposite feeling and didn't want to share. It was just the right amount of sweetness with the vanilla ice cream and sweet fruits like mango and strawberry topped with chocolate syrup. The prices were worth the tastiness. If my daughter ends up coming here, we'll definitely be back!",
            "The crepe's a super freak! I'd really like to taste it.... Let's start off that I'm not usually a fan of crepes. I grew up with Polish nalesniki which are just homemade crepes with any filling you could desire. So when the crepe rage hit the US, I was underwhelmed. But I wanted something sweet and it was late in the evening, this place was close by and open. I love the sitting arrangements in this place. They have futon couches, tables and bar seating near the window. Plenty of choices for whatever sitting mood you're in (that's a thing, ya know?!) I choose the futon couches with the sparkly pillows. That's the kind of mood I was in. You place your order, have a seat, and then they call you up when your order is ready. We split the mango-berry crepe. I wasn't expecting it to come out looking like a cone. But ok cool, easy to hold. I'm a fan. The taste was good, on the positive it wasn't too sweet or over soaked, on the negative I do wish it had more cream filling throughout and not just on the bottom. All in all.... That crepe's pretty kinky.... *continues dancing to Rick James*",
            "Been here twice now. Haven't tried as many things yet, but I liked what I ate!!! Had the cheesecake crepe and the takoyaki. The crepe was SO GOOD. I felt the Takoyaki could be better, though. But I really enjoyed the crepe. The interior is SUPER cute but it seems really small to me. They also have drinks in cute lightbulb cups. Looking forward to next visit to try more of their menu!!!"

            "There's more to this place than bakery. To be honest, I prefer the other bakery in Little Italy as far as sweets. But I will say this... Presti's has THE BEST Coconut Macaroon on the planet. I go there just to get those alone. They are huge, crusty on the outside, soft and delicate on the inside and half dipped in dark chocolate. Be sure not to put these babies in plastic though, they are best when the outside is crusty. Best to eat them as soon as you get them! There are some other notable baked goods, like the brownie cookie, the soft biscotti cookies, anise cookies and the higher end stuff in the far case like tiramisu and iced brownies. They also make a killer cappuccino. Now here is where Presti's shines... they've got tons of good food and their space is super cozy. Whenever I come home and don't feel like cooking, I head over to Presti's for some takeout. I love the chicken picatta and marsala, the clam linguini, the various other pasta dishes. Their cold salads like egg, potato and chicken salad taste like you made it at home. There's this polenta bake that I absolutely LOVE. The pizza is pretty decent, although I usually end up throwing on more cheese. At breakfast time, they have great croissant sandwiches. Generally, the food is very good and reasonably priced. There's a lot to choose from and the offerings aren't always the same. Presti's is a great place to sit and hang. The inside is warm and inviting and the outside seating is great. They are in the perfect location. You can enjoy free Wi-Fi as well. You will always find a bunch of locals on laptops. Be sure to take a number if need be. When it is really busy, they will go by the number tickets.",
            "Presti's best dessert is their custard fruit tart (weekends only). Cannoli is okay, but if you get it later in the day, it tends to be soggy and cold. The other desserts vary depending on freshness. But it's not above Presti's to still serve stale desserts well after their prime time. I came here a lot this semester because of the great atmosphere. It's my \"happy place\" in Cleveland. Their lunch foods, though appealing from behind the glass, NEED some improvement. It's not even big changes - little things, like actually adding salt, spices, not having the pasta soak in its own sauce for hours, or putting enough filling in the strombolis. When they have the sandwiches out, get them! They're possibly the only certain delicious item on the lunch menu! Personal favorite. Coffee is yucky! Bland, with little suspicious pools of oil floating on top. Tea is okay though, and they have a respectable selection. My little brother loves their hot chocolate topped with whip. To their credit, despite some questionable foods, Presti's service is TOPS. I love the older lady with blonde hair and a big smile. They are always happy to help, and that is enough to bring me back time and time again. I visit all the time, and have only met one exception to the rule: a younger, dark-haired male server with a very bad attitude (I once asked him to re-heat my ice-cold chicken pot pie, and he over-cooked it, forgot about it, and then tossed it at me when I asked for it back without an apology! Bad day for him, I guess, or he's just an ass. Have avoided him since.) If I'm honest with myself, though I love Presti's and come back often, I don't think it would survive if it had a little more competition. They have to rethink their lunch menu, or not offer lunch at all. And if the desserts are stale, don't sell them. It isn't worth damaging your reputation. The only viable competition for them is Corbo's up the street - not enough to catalyze any serious change.",
            "Oh My Goodness BEST Cannolis EVER!! WOW this place is the real deal and a must try!! This Bakery is in Little Italy of Cleveland there is street parking but not a lot we got lucky and got a place right in front of Presti`s!! There is outside seating and also indoor seating, the service is excellent. We went try there Cannolis I had heard the were very good, there was not any in the show case so we asked and she checked in the back she came back and said it would be 10 minutes we said that fine we ordered some pastries and two double espressos, and by the time we were done she came out with are Cannolis. We ordered a Lobster Tail which was so delicious and my husband had the blueberry Cheesecake also very good. We brought are Cannolis home and had them the next morning and WOW I swear they are the BEST Cannolis EVER!! Very nice Bakery very clean place with nice seating area, they also sell gelato and cookies and a cafe menu for lunch I really can`t wait to go back for another visit. The waitstaff that helped us was so friendly and was saying how sorry for the wait for the cannolis I said it was really no problem we were not in a hurry and enjoyed have some pastries and espresso",
            "I have a bad cough and it's a little bit CHESTY I don't like Tolkein, it's a little bit QUESTY I don't like politics, they make me dePRESSEDY I like the East Coast but I really love the WESTY I don't like boys but girls are the BESTY Tall girls from Prague, Sofia and BUCURESTI I like Pam Anderson and she's rather BREASTY Speaking of which, a porn star is my BESTIE I sometimes like boys when my bottom feels EMPTY I like my friend Zain cause he's so ZESTY I like to be Louder but I don't like ESTEE I don't like cops cause they try to ARREST ME The older server here gets a little bit TESTY Maybe cuz in winter I go in here in my VESTY I like Colgate but I'm not a fan of CRESTY And girls like me the way they liked Elvis PRESLEY I don't like Coke and I don't like PEPSI I like Marisa but not Joe PESCI I like bakeries but they make me feel HEFTY I like artists but they can be a bit SKETCHY I wish I had that guy's girl, what's his name? JESSIE I once got molested by a man named WESLEY* I love Barcelona and Suarez and MESSI And will a dozen cannolis make my tummy look SEXY? I like Italian stuff, from cars to CONFETTI Lasagne too, pizza, and SPAGHETTI If Italian girls don't like me, it's cause they never MET ME Some of these don't rhyme cause I'm a little bit RUSTY No matter, let's go and get pastry from PRESTI WHAT If your server is rude, just Presti button and a new one will appear! OK that's not true, but the pastries are so good, you won't care. I have to thank Robert in Portland for sending me to this beautiful Bakery. I got all kinds of really awesome pastries and treats, and even though they were sold out of a lot of stuff I very much enjoyed all of it. Some of the servers are not as friendly as others, but my one was really lovely. Biscotti is still biscotti (I've never been impressed), but the cookie and the cannoli were excellent. I got a few extras for the cookie lovers and cannoli lovers back in Buffalo, and they absolutely loved them. I'm not sure if the Cannoli is as good as Brooklyn, but it's definitely in the same ball park (ew I just used a Baseball metaphor ew ew ew) which is a massive compliment, but not as massive as my... Cheesecake. Cheesecake is pricey and wasn't amazing, but that's because the basic, which they're not as famous for, is all they had. Perhaps the Italian and chocolate versions will be better. I noticed Presti's has lots of good-looking customers (hi Italian girls) and a pretty strange format. You take a number and then wait (for what seems like decades) to be served. True Italian style. Mamma mia. It's in the beautiful old Little Italy neighborhood of East Cleveland, and in many ways is the heart of the neighborhood. There's a reason it's always so busy and if you love bakeries you should try this for yourself. Usually I'd avoid gorging on such delights (yes I'm still talking about Italian desserts... the pastry kind), but when you look at who we have as the Prestient of the USA, I think I can be forgiven for a little binging.",
            "Food is a hit or miss Dessert is decent First with the negative (and im being a little nit picky with some of these) : -The orange sauce (dare I call it Vodka sauce?) they use on several of their pastas is as bland as sauces come. I get this undesirable powder-y aftertaste each time I give it a chance, hoping for improvement. PLEASE, add some salt (and other seasonings)! Also, a little less cream wouldn't hurt either -Unless you like water with mysterious flakes and hair from unknown origins, stay away from the complimentary water by the utensil area. PLEASE clean that dispenser! -I used to come just for the stromboli (sausage and spinach), but recently it has become a lot doughier with less filling and more bread. The ratio was great before, please bring that back! I'd rather have a smaller piece with more filling to dough ratio than a large bready one -If you are charging $4-5 for a small slice of carrot cake, please make sure it is still fresh. The one time I got it, it was so dry and miserable I threw it out -Please find a donut-man asap! I really miss your old donuts! But why does Presti's still get 4 stars in my book? Atmosphere I don't come to Presti's craving anything in particular (except the cannoli, and the eggplant parm), I come because Presti's has created this consistent, wonderful vibe in their animated bakery, with their friendly staff, large-glass windows, and customers of all ages. Even when Cleveland is bringing you down on a depressing grey Sunday morning, a warm coffee with a pastry at Presti's will guarantee to lift your spirits. Maybe it's the warm lighting, maybe it's the friendly staff, maybe it's the rich selection of desserts, Presti's just has that special something that you don't find in any of the other food stops in Little Italy. Also, Presti's is one of the most fairly priced places to eat in the area. You can get a stromboli, a side of pesto tortellini, a coffee, and a cookie, all for around $10! That itself should be enough reason to go I really do think that with a few minor tweaks, this lively bakery could be \"As good as it gets!~\" Food: B- Atmosphere: A Service: B"

            "Dripps is a trendy little ice cream and tea shop branching from Pokitrition. Ambiance: A faux greenery back wall flashes bright LED lettering \"Dripp it like it's hot.\" Absolutely Instagram-worthy surely attracting millennials including myself. Customers stayed behind waiting to lick their ice cream cones so they can take the perfect picture with the cute backdrop. Within hours of opening, many, many people have already posted pictures on social media. I think they did a good job of promoting the new place so many people who are active on social media were aware of it. Grand Opening: The grand opening of Dripps was this past Saturday, September 29th. The place was open from 4 p.m. until 10:30 p.m. My friend and I didn't want to wait so long in line, so we came after dinner around 8:30. The line was still super long! So congrats, Dripps Co., on the successful new venture. Your soft serves and colorful teas are a hit! All items were BOGO and will be BOGO for the first week since opening. Soft Serve Ice Cream: 1. Cup or Cone (one size only) 2. Mix-In: All soft serves are vanilla only and you can choose your favorite childhood cereal including Lucky Charms, Cap'n Crunch, Frosted Flakes, Honey Bunches of Oats, Honey Nut Cheerios, Cookie Crisp, Froot Loops, and many more, that they will blend in with the vanilla soft serve. 3. Toppings: You can choose from a list of toppings they have. Most of them are more dry cereal but a few toppings I spotted are the usual froyo toppings like cookie dough and crushed oreos. You can pay 50 cents extra for other toppings from a list that includes fruit and other yummies. Cup of Soft Serve w/ One Topping: I ordered the soft serve in a cup mixed with one of my favorite super sugary childhood cereals, Cap'N Crunch. I topped it with cheesecake bites, my go-to topping at froyo places. The combination was amazing. The ice cream is so rich and creamy, the amount that they serve is just enough. The cereal mixed in was a little crunchy and grainy, but still so delicious. I highly recommend the soft serves. I think even just the plain soft serve would have been tasty! Teas + Coffee: They also serve matcha teas, rose milk teas, matcha coffees, and thai tea. You can add boba to it if you like. I still need to try these, but I have heard from the other customers, that they do not disappoint. My next visit, I would love to try either the rose milk or matcha coffee. Everything is aesthetically pleasing, I'm sure the taste matches the beauty of these drinks as well!",
            "DRIPPS is my answered prayer and biggest blessing to the Chandler area this year. I'm not kidding when I say I come here at least once a week. When they first opened in September, it was even more than that, taking advantage of their soft opening and grand opening discount and BOGO. They are an awesome company, from the owners over at Pokitrition. The star here is CEREAL INFUSED SOFT SERVE. And no, it is not just some cereal just sprinkled into the ice cream. It is generous amounts of cereal of your choice literally DRILLED in and it is the best cereal ice cream in the world. I am a huge fan of Christina Tosi's Milkbar cereal ice cream, but Dripps takes it to a whole other level. I can assure you your favorite childhood cereal is among their choices. They do have signature creations you could choose from and mix and match toppings, but what I love to do is just choose a cereal and use the same cereal as topping. Their \"supporting actor\" I would say is their matcha drinks. If you love matcha, you will be in heaven. They use real QUALITY matcha. Great flavor, good caffeine kick without the jitters. Next favorite is the rose milk tea. It's not too \"flowery\" it is more milky which I love. Their milk teas are good as well. The only one negative thing is the boba balls are not as soft as I would love them to be but I enjoy milk teas without boba so they get a pass. The whole concept is just amazing and I'll shout it from the rooftops if I could. I LOVE DRIPPS!",
            "Dripp it like it's hot! Dripp is the newest concept from the gang at Pokitrition but now they are serving up classic Boba and Cereal infused ice cream! Today was their Grand opening and people came out in droves. The wait was a bit but it was worth it. They offer Matcha direct from Japan, infused in several drinks as well as some other classics. I got the sweet Matcha and my husband got the Hojicha Latte. The sweetness from the whipped cream along with the Matcha was a perfect combination. The Hojicha was a nice taste since the Matcha was toasted. Their most expensive drink is the Coconut Matcha but that is because it is served in a coconut. So if you want a fun and refreshing aesthetic, hit it up! The ice cream, was absolutely delicious. You can create your own or they have 9 signature creations. Starts with a vanilla base, choose from one of 17 cereals to mix with the ice cream and last but not least, choose your toppings. We chose to do two of the signature ice creams. The cookies and cream along with the frooty tooty. The have a cool machine that blends at high speed, really helps to mix it all up. Overall, the Frooty Tooty was not only gorgeous but so tasty! The fruity combination with the strawberry syrup was delectable. Lastly, the cookies and cream was super creamy and adorable. Make sure to snap a picture against their adorable leafy wallpaper or the aesthetically pleasing neon light/boxwood combination. Tons of free parking, a decent size for seating and a great new addition to the area. Now you have an excuse to eat cereal for dessert.",
            "Short Review: An odd boba shop to sum up. I will go more into details down below, but for this section, I'll just say their ice cream was delicious, the milk tea was good, and the inside of the shop is very sleek and clean and smells nice. Service was good too. Long Review: Rewind - Ice Cream + Boba Tea is a shop that specialize in dessert drinks and ice cream. But here is what's odd, they sell CEREAL! That's right, you heard me right, they offer breakfast cereal at a boba shop. I have never heard of such shop before until now. I honestly, don't know how it works, like do they just serve ordinary cereal where they just pour regular 2% or whole milk with retail bought cereal? I didn't ask because I'm not a cereal guy, but it would certainly be interesting if they offered milk tea boba cereal or something. Moving on, the inside has a nice beige cream overall interiors that makes it a pleasant sight to see. For menu, there are four categories: Teas, Ice Cream, Milk Shake, and Cereal. I got a Rose Milk Tea and Vanilla infused with matcha and almonds soft-serve ice cream. I don't care for cereal and while milk shake does sounds nice, I was more curious about their milk tea section at that time. It took about 3 minutes for my Rose Milk Tea and another 3 minute for my ice cream. Rose Milk Tea With Boba: I was intrigue by the gradient color layer of the drink. If that's their intention, then well done. It also taste fairly good for something that looked overly hyped. The taste reminds me of fruit loops cereal with lavender tea with milk and floral from the tea itself. When the drink is blended together, the color will change into light purple or lilac color. As for the boba, I was a little disappointed. The taste was good, but the chew was okay, but the worse part was the boba was stuck together into chunks. It was impossible to suck the rest of the boba even with boba straw. I'm guessing whoever cooked the boba, didn't stir it enough, and as a result, the boba get stuck together like that. Vanilla Soft-Serve Ice Cream With Matcha Infused + Almonds: At first, I was confused because I thought there were only two flavored ice, which was vanilla and chocolate, but I was wrong. You have two other steps which involved infused flavor and toppings for last. Any other extra will cost more, so keep that in mind. But anyway, this soft-serve ice was insanely good. As I eat this soft-serve ice cream over a hot summer season, my mind melted away. Such delicate, soft, smooth, and creamy consistency and texture. I was blown away at how good it was. And I have ate soft-serve in Disneyland, which was seriously good. Rewind, by far did the best soft-serve ice cream as far as I can tell. Although, the matcha infused was subtle, it still was a delightful treat that is hard to beat. Overall, I rate the quantity for milk tea/ice cream a B/A and in quality a -A/A+. Milk tea quantity is the same as many other boba shop. Price vs portion ratio are often the same. For ice cream, you get loads of ice cream at a great deal. For quality, Rose Milk Tea was great, but boba was terrible. Ice cream, by far, one of the best I've had, so it get an A+. It has a chance of reaching S rank, but the matcha was too subtle. If the matcha was a little stronger, I would give the ice cream an S rank. Otherwise, I gotta try their milk shake next time, now that I know their soft-serve is delicious.",
            "After seeing some positive reviews about Rewind, I wanted to stop by and check it out for myself. A store that sells boba and ice cream at the same time? Say less and hook me up because I'm coming over at the speed of light. Now onto the review: Dessert/Drink (3/5): For the drink, I got a Blueberry Matcha Latte and I got the Matcha Madness (in a cone) for dessert. Let's start with the drink. As someone who absolutely loves matcha, I knew I had to order this. It is different from most matcha drinks I typically see in which this one comes with blueberry puree. The drink was a good size for what the price was; however, the drink isn't that spectacular. The matcha flavor was nice but the blueberry didn't really add any wow factor to the drink. If anything, I felt as if I couldn't ever taste the blueberry so that was rather disappointing. The Matcha Madness ice cream included the following toppings: two pocky sticks and chocolate shavings. I find that the ice cream itself was pretty smooth and had a really good matcha flavor to it. Only downside was that it was really melty within a minute and the ice cream wasn't as pretty/have a nice swirling effect. Atmosphere (5/5): The establishment was really pretty and I absolutely love the vibe. Decor was pretty minimal but any place that has a neon sign and a grass wall is amazing in my eyes haha. The store was also very clean and neat. Seating was pretty limited as there was only 4 - 5 tables. Service (4/5): Service was alright. I didn't find it to special or felt that workers went out of their way. Did notice that a worker was talking to their buddies when people were waiting to order. Overall, just lack of attention to customers; however, the drink and ice cream came out at a good pace. Overall, Rewind offers customers a good mixture of drinks and ice cream selection to satisfy any sweet cravings. The attention to customer could be improved but timing between order and handout was good. Would I come back? If I was in the area then maybe, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to go. Might only get ice cream if I go though as the drink was average."

            "Just went here for the first time and it is LITERALLY AMAZING!!! I got the unicorn poop ice cream and it is delicious! Probably one of the best vanilla ice creams i've had in my entire life!!! It has purple vanilla (so cool am I right), sprinkles, and cupcake pieces, really good, strong flavors! Such a cool atmosphere, tons of different flavors and options, and the NICEST workers ever. They are so helpful and welcoming, very professional! Great size area, amazing family atmosphere!! I will DEFINITELY be coming back!! D to the E to the L-I-O-U-S!! I will be telling ALL of my family and friends about this place, it is just that good. My friend got the grasshopper and she agrees, it is amazing! Hers was mint chocolate with thin mints and oreos, not your average mint chocolate chip ice cream!!Such a unique selection of ice creams!! and they don't just have ice cream! They have shaved ice and halo-halo. If i could give it more than five stars I definitely would!! Thank you Scooptopia, very cool!",
            "I heard about this place from a friend and how they have the best Halo Halo in Phoenix. I may not be the best point of reference because I only had Halo Halo once or twice in my life so I don't know if I had the best baseline. Upon walking in the shop, I was warmly greeted by the workers. I was the only one in the shop and get offered to answer any questions I had. They have a vast array of ice cream. They do not make their own ice cream but buys from a local ice cream supplier. If you want options for both traditional and slightly different flavors, I definitely recommend coming here. Additionally, they have shave ice and other specialty desserts, like Halo Halo. I ordered the Halo Halo and eating it was like a party in my mouth. So many textures and flavors in one dessert. No component was too sweet or an odd texture. It all worked together really well. Overall, it was a balanced dessert. The dessert comprises of shave ice, jellies, beans, nuts, and a cookie straw. The best part? The taro ice cream! It was flavorful and rich! I would go back just for the ice cream! I don't even really know all of the ingredients but I just remember it being really good. The dessert was around 6 dollars, which I was totally fine with because it goes to supporting local businesses. I recommend giving them a try because they are good people with a good business!",
            "Been here twice for the halo halo and love it! I'm so glad there's an Asian-inspired dessert spot that is so close by. The GM here is super nice. I love being able to sample ice cream and drinks. But let's get to the good stuff - the halo halo is amazing. It's made fresh by hand when you order, so it's not a premade concoction sitting in a freezer. If it was socially and fiscally acceptable to get one every day, I totally would. But I'll stick to getting it as a treat here and there. There's everything from red bean, to ube ice cream, egg pudding, beans, coconut jelly, etc. that make it taste authentic and homemade. The small is a good size equivalent to a short milk shake. The large is pretty huge, looks double the size of the small. Both sizes have all the toppings proportionately. They also have little treats like Pocky available for purchase. Go try it out! The quality is great, and the price point is fair. Makes it that much better, yum!",
            "If you're looking for the best ice cream in town look no further. Scooptopia has, by far, the best ice cream that I've ever had, with such a diverse selection of flavors. What makes it even better is that they also offer drinks and deserts outside of their ice cream that have all been absolutely fantastic, and believe me, I've tried almost everything on the menu. My personal favorites are the oatmeal cookie ice cream, Thai tea and halo halo! It's hard to find many places in Phoenix that serve traditional Filipino deserts such as the halo halo, but Scooptopia gets it perfect every time! On top of the food and drinks earning a five star review on their own, the staff and owners are some of the most kind and friendly people that you could ever meet. Every time we come in, we are greeted right away and it makes coming to Scooptopia so pleasant. You can really tell that not only the staff, but also the owners are great people who really want to make sure that you enjoy your time at their shop! If you're considering going out for a desert in Phoenix, I would recommend Scooptopia over anywhere else ten times out of ten!",
            "What a gem!!! My boyfriend and I visited this spot with his aunt after it came up as a yelp suggestion. We were warmly greeted by the owners who were so kind (Filipino people are always very warm and welcoming)! We knew before going in that we wanted to order their special halo halo, but were pleasantly surprised to see they also started offering Taho (Filipino dessert with soft tofu, brown sugar syrup, and tapioca balls) and Sago Gulaman (Filipino grass jelly drink)!!! We ordered all three and they were ALL SO GOOOD. My boyfriend is Filipino so I've had my share of Filipino cuisine and these desserts were one of the best I've had! For the taho we tried the taro flavor which I've never seen before and it's a must try! And the sago gulaman is the perfect refreshment on a sunny day. We also got a pint of their local made ice cream to take home (they have so many unique flavors) and some cookies!!! Trust me there were more things we wanted to try but we'll just have to wait for next time since we got so much haha. All in all the desserts here are delicious, the quality is excellent, and the service was unbeatable. Def a local business you'll want to support and see thrive!!! If you're near the midtown area in Phoenix I highly suggest you stop by! (it's right next to the light rail)"

            "I've been coming to this ice cream stand since I was a little girl back in the 1970's. (Yes, it's been here for that long! Just not under the same ownership.) But not much has changed in those years in regards to their basic ice cream. It is a great family place! They are always accommodating when we want to tweak the menu item a bit :-) I love the rotating, special flavor of the week! Keep an eye on the Facebook page for that. It's always a joy to see the near constant long line. Shows how successful a small town business can be. If you are truly passionate about supporting small business, stay away from those franchises that make their ice cream at some corporate factory and come get some made fresh soft serve from your truly local business!!",
            "This is one of my favorite places to get ice cream in the CU area. It's a bit of drive, but it is worth it. It's about 10 minutes from the far side of Urbana. Getting there is really easy. The atmosphere of the Dairy Barn is very kid friendly. There are many tables set up so that you can sit and enjoy the ice cream. When my friends and I went, the line was about a 20 minute wait, but it didn't seem like any time at all. An older gentlemen, I presume the manager or owner, was giving out samples to the entire line. You could tell that he took pride in the product he made and was excited to share it with everyone. The special that night was cappuccino ice cream. I added in cookie dough to make a \"tornado\" which is a blizzard like ice cream treat. It was so quite refreshing and was a nice treat on a humid night. The Dairy barn is a must go!",
            "I LOVE the Dairy Barn. 20 minutes east of CU, this is the picture perfect small town ice cream place. Outdoor, order at the window and sit on the picnic tables under the festive outdoor lighting to enjoy your soft serve treats. Chocolate and vanilla always available, with a rotating special third flavor (I love mint week!). There are always special tornadoes (think blizzard) to match the flavor of the week. I also recommend the raspberry truffle tornado; raspberry flavored ice cream with magic shell-like dipping chocolate mixed in. If you want a short journey and some awesome ice cream, go to Sidney Dairy Barn! Update: I love Dairy Barn. It should have 5 stars. What's my problem?",
            "This place is the bomb, and absolutely the kind of place that makes it worth searching around for the best local joints on a road trip. We spotted it on a hiking trip and made a stop on our way out, and it was flat-out amazing, as you could probably guess based on the long lines stretching out at dusk. The service was incredibly efficient for such a tiny joint, and they had a good selection of flavors; but the food was the real attraction, amazing ice cream desserts made from that fresh country cream that you can taste the minute it hits your tongue. It's also got 1970s prices, which makes the massive sugar rush all the more worthwhile.",
            "Delicious ice cream. Best soft serve I've ever had in my entire life. Staff is wonderful and friendly and even though they only have a few flavors it will leave you in a wonderful happy place and life will be good."

            "I've started this review multiple times but words always seem to fall short and feel inadequate to describe this true diamond in the steel buckle of the rust belt! First the owner of the shop isn't the absentee kind. He's a mad genius behind the counter creating dare I say it sinfully delectable chocolate creations that befuddle the mind! Not to mention he's a genuinely nice guy who exudes a true passion for his chocolate. Now you can have your Mr. Wizard, Bill Nye, or Dr. Frankenstein but he is a true mad scientist with his dark and milk chocolate alchemy! I mean chocolate covered bacon, scumdiddlyumptious truffles, milk shakes spun by hand with what could be termed interesting but delicious ice cream offerings, and my personal favorite the chocolate enveloped peanut butter loved rice crispy treats!!! Now add to all of this incredible edible chocolate/confectionery is the staff. Not only do you find yourself in hand crafted amazing chocolaty goodness but you have a collection of friendly, fun, fantastic ,folks to guide you into the plethora of choices that will leave you weak in the knees and begging for mercy to tear into the amazing bag of goodies you're sure to leave with! I can't stop getting enough of the amazing treats, great people, and I almost forgot to mention with the cold setting in to Pittsburgh their mind blowing, game changing, dare I say soul warming hot chocolate sure to melt away the frostbite nipping at your nose, toes, and stomach. With so many options of Sinful Sweets to choose from I will have to keep visiting again, and again, and again!",
            "I am officially in love. Sinful Sweets DESTROYS any chocolate/candy store in existence. Not only do they have awesome, friendly, fun staff, but the expansive selection of chocolates, truffles, cake pops AND ice cream is fantastic. They even have samples of their chocolate out to try! Sure, the building this little place resides in may be a bit run down, but I think it just gives it personality! The shop inside is cute and modern. Milkshake Happy Hour (25% off from 4-7 p.m.)!! The girl working (I wish I'd gotten her name!) was awesomely patient and helpful as I debated for several minutes between flavors. Finally, I decided to go wild and got bittersweet symphony (coffee & chocolate), mint chocolate chip, red velvet, chocolate cookie dough & piece of cake (since you get four scoops of ice cream, I split the cake and cookie dough flavors). At my request, she blended in tons of (free!) extras, like Reese's and Butterfingers pieces. Finally, I asked her to top my shake with Andes mints, which she did enthusiastically. It came with a big, fat cute straw DIPPED in chocolate on the tip for an extra burst of chocolately goodness with each sip. She said it was the craziest shake she had made yet :) IT WAS HEAVEN. I'm surprised I didn't spiral into depression at the final sip. All the extras that didn't get blended in were at the bottom, soaked in milkshakey goodness, so I got to spoon it out for even more deliciousness. Go here. You will be addicted.",
            "Wow, I definitely wasn't expecting to be blown away by a dessert shop in a mall food court! But, I definitely am. While at Ross Park Mall, I stopped by Sinful Sweets (or as their sign says, 'Cookies and Cream') and got some vanilla ice cream, a peanut butter deep dish cookie, and a chocolate macaron deep dish. There was only one lady working at the shop. She was extremely friendly. When it was time to pay, she tried to put the cookies into a cookie box but they ran out. Instead, she offered to put them in a different box and take the ice cream off of the price! That is extremely generous of her! The vanilla ice cream is delicious. Not too sweet, but has the exact flavor you want from a creamy vanilla ice cream. I only asked for a scoop, but it was 4 or 5! The cookie and macaron were both also delicious. For $3.50 each, it's definitely worth the price. These are thick, dense, and large cookies. The peanut butter has lots of Reeses on top of what seems to be a chocolate chip cookie. The edges are crispy and inside is pretty soft. The macaron was one of the best I've had. It was chocolate dipped, and also huge! Full of coconut. They also have chocolate, cupcakes, cookie dough, and milkshakes among other items. For a little shop in Ross Park Mall, this is beyond high quality! The young lady working there is awesome, too. And, the food is all delicious, from the cookies to the ice cream! Definitely recommend.",
            "Sinful Sweets is beyond amazing! This review is for their kiosk in the Ross Park Mall, but they do have an actual bakery on Liberty Avenue in Pittsburgh too! The Sinful Sweets kiosk is always stocked full of bakery items, especially lots of great flavors of their edible cookie dough! The employees are super friendly and always willing to help and let you try samples to determine which items you like best. So far, my favorites are the Sugar Cookie Edible Cookie Dough and Red Velvet Edible Cookie Dough. The edible cookie doughs taste so fresh and stay good in the fridge for about five months. I would highly recommend this place! I've had an amazing experience every time I've been here, and the kiosk at the mall is so convenient for you to just grab something while you're already out shopping!",
            "I stopped by Sinful Sweets this past Thurs. at 7pm. I'd had Sinful Sweets bookmarked for a long while, but this was the first time I received the chance to stop by, given that they close at 8pm. Usually, if I'm downtown at this time, I'm headed to a show in the Cultural District, and am not quite ready for dessert yet. This time, however, I was headed back from a vigorous paddle at Kayak PGH, which allowed me to justify stopping by to indulge myself. In checking out the reviews beforehand, it seemed that the most popular items at Sinful Sweets are milkshakes and cake pops. Upon perusing the display case, there were surprisingly few cake pops left, so I decided to go with a milkshake ($5). The guy working (probably the owner) told me that the price included one mix-in (others are extra), and that I could have my milkshake made from two different types of ice cream if I wanted. After perusing the options, I ordered a milkshake with chocolate and cannoli ice cream with Andes pieces as a mix-in. My custom milkshake turned out to be a delectable creation. Its size and thickness were comparable to those of milkshakes from the Milkshake Factory, and the cannoli ice cream lent a nice creaminess to it in combination with the chocolate ice cream. Numerous small chocolate chips from the cannoli ice cream, as well as the Andes pieces, lent textural interest to the milkshake, culminating in a delicious pile of candy at the bottom of the cup for a sweet finish. Although Sinful Sweets doesn't stock as many different ice cream flavors as the Milkshake Factory, their milkshakes are more customizable if you account for the ability to mix flavors and the candy mix-ins, and they use the same brand of ice cream (Perry's). As was mentioned in a relatively recent review, I didn't receive a chocolate dipped straw, so perhaps they've stopped the practice of dipping straws in chocolate (I didn't ask). In addition to my milkshake, I received a dark chocolate dipped pretzel for checking in on Yelp. This was a nice bonus, esp. since I accidentally left behind some chocolate peanut butter dipped pretzels that I purchased last weekend at my parents' place, which were promptly devoured by my dad before I could ask my parents to ship them to me. :-( Overall, I was quite pleased with my visit to Sinful Sweets. Service was friendly, and the price of the milkshake was right in line with the Milkshake Factory. As others have mentioned, they have a daily milkshake happy hour during weekdays from 4-6pm (25% off), so if you're able to take advantage of it, you can get a milkshake for even less money. While I was very pleased with my milkshake, I'm not awarding a full five stars because of the lack of cake pops (I heard the owner explain to another customer that they were sold out because someone had made a large purchase of them earlier). However, this could be a good thing, as it gives me motivation to return and update my review! 4.5 stars."

            "\"Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.\" Take a stroll with me! Remember when you were little, holding mama's hand in line patiently for ice cream. Perhaps it was daddy's special day, looking around from the top of the world. Up on daddy's strong shoulders, safe and ready for ice cream treats. How happy you were. Now your the mama or daddy! It's time to take your children to get ice cream. Remember the special moments that were created for your. This ice cream parlor is a throwback to the days when ice cream parlors were in style. It's those whimsical dreams that we can share and re-enjoy again and again with generation after generation. Remember this ice cream parlor is located inside the Venetian shops. It's a wonderful place, but it's touristy heavy. It was created to make you stop in and feel good. The ice cream is always delicious, always the staff has those smiling faces. It's the cost that will set you back. You decide the price of your happy. Sure for what you get sometimes the price will shock. As a local in Vegas, I would highly recommend this spot just for the memories that will come from it. If your familiar with Eddie World in Yermo, California: same kind of similarity. It's worth the happiness that ice cream joy makes for the family. Is that sundae worth it? This is sort of a build it your own ice cream happy. For around $10 it's a few scoops of ice cream, whip cream, sprinkles, caramel or chocolate sauce; and that cherry on top! If your a fudge brownie kind of sweetness type, they have that loaded with all those sweet options on top. If your looking so ice cream, just \"ice cream,\" it's here too. Many different flavors exist, with a few twists and turns. Come discover what ice cream concoction makes your heart flutter. It's the post COVID world now, masks are a mandatory in Las Vegas. While ordering keep your mask on. The employees here return to the customer, a clean environment for us all to exist in. Between customers we observed an employee whose dedicated position was to cleanliness. The atmosphere of the store even feels clean. So many delicious treats stare back from the glass, and the main consumer is children. The glass was hand print free and all sparkles. It's got a streak free shine on those windows. How we appreciate all the cleaning and sanitizing that the staff performs! Thank you for all your hard efforts and works at keeping us all safe. Because they care, our cashier was happy and upbeat. As we waited in line, the rules of COVID have switched up how we interact these days. We must remember six feet apart. You have to wait in line just a little longer. As we stand here, check your IG account! Check in on Yelp!! We did! The worth for their glamorous ice cream is worth it. All forms of payment are accepted here. The touch less forms are becoming more prevalent than cash!! It's Vegas, so cash is still \"king\" here. After ordering they usher you down the line where the crew will directly hand off your sundae to you. If you order consists of a donut or cookie; it is called separately. Either way the orders go in order as placed; and handed off. Every wonder what Homer Simpson feels like when he holds that pink sprinkles donut. \"Homer like, mmmmm donuts!\" Come and be epic! The large Homer Pink Sprinkles donut is available here. This epic donut is offered in power blue with rainbow sprinkles. No matter what color or flavor of Homer Donut you choose; it's a delicious choice. The Homer Donut is delicious. As you enjoy that first bite it takes me back to when Homer had a chance to live in raining donut land. The time machine jumped, too late. Now you can have that moment anytime you want while enjoying your small piece of the Simpson's. Take you little ones hand and take them out. Due to COVID our family members get togetherness has diminished. Take back family time and be happy. Make new memories. Rebuild old paths with new steps. Let your heart flutter and beat fast as you laugh and smile. Ice cream makes every one scream! Now scream, loud! Louder!! We want ice cream! Please!!",
            "If you are in The Venetian hotel and are craving ice cream, cookies, brownies, or just sweet treats in general then look no further. You will not find a better place nearby. Trust me I have tried. The moment you see it you cannot help but be excited and feel invited by the bright pink colors. It looks like a child fantasy store. And you will feel like a kid again when you walk in. The ice cream here has no food coloring or dyes, unlike most other ice cream stores. This is truly luxury homemade ice cream. The best of the best. High quality and real ingredients. Ice cream is rBST free/hormone free. But most importantly it is all truly delicious. They have something for everyone here. They even have vegan options (like vegan cookies and ice cream). But they also have many toys for kids as well. Great for last minute gifts. Or gifts in general. Overall a truly wonderful store with extremely delicious treats.",
            "I am an ice cream lover & connoisseur! While I travel globally frequently I have never seen such innovative flavors before! The flavors were awesome & the staff was pure joy! I LOVE ice cream. There were a million flavors.. ok well not a million but a lot. I think I fell in love when I saw carrot cake ice cream! To make things worse, actually better... I was trying to behave & not over indulge but the kind server offered to make me a fresh waffle cone to go with my ice cream. So.. I tried a scoop of almond joy ice cream & a scoop of carrot cake ice cream. Pure joy & satisfaction. The ice cream is great & the store was fun with great decor and other cookies, sweets, and things. If you love ice cream, you must try this place.",
            "So we officially have Sloan's and it's inside the grand canal Shops in the palazzo. So before you even see the shop you will smell the heavenly scents of chocolate and ice cream and sweet treats from the hallways leading up to it. I must say that the shop decor is fun and super inviting, it will truly make you feel like a kid in a candy shop and you will just want to buy everything you see So even though everything looked amazing there is no way I can eat that much sweets so I decided on a cookie and brownie and let me tell you there is NO way you can or will be disappointed. The cookie is the best cookie I ever tasted but beware it is super duper rich, the cookies are served warm and they come with big chunk of either chocolate chip or peanut butter cups. I could not even finish the cookie all at one time. Now on to the brownie, it is soft with crispy edges which I love with a moist center full of just rich chocolatey goodness. I had no idea a sweet could be so sweet lol. I would definitely come back again and try those gigantic donuts or some of the home made waffles that smelt like grandmas house or the Carmel apples or homemade ice cream..... fresh there is so many choice that you can't go wrong",
            "Only in Las Vegas can you escape the real life dream come true of hanging out by a Venice canal in St. Marks Square to feel like a little kid for a few minutes in a candy store. That happened to me on a staycation evening last week. Both my dad (who flew in from New York) and I appreciate hanging out inside the Venetian's St. Marks Square. It is the next best way to spend time in Venice to the real Venice. To make quality time in this quality Venice meets Vegas resort even better is delicious food. Under the bright blue sky ceiling above St. Mark's Square is Sloan's Ice Cream Parlor. At ground level, it was a short stroll across a pedestrian bridge crossing the Venice Canal. Savoring my time in this dreamscape of Venice themed eye candy it was time for me to savor some real candy: ice cream. Originating in Florida, Sloan's is an ice cream shop chain that produces walls of delectable treats including doughnuts, cookies, and a wall of candy. They sell adorable gifts including stuffed animals. Just walking along the cobblestone Venice walkway, my eyes were drawn from the gandolas and canal to these puppies sleeping in a cage by the entrance. Upon further inspection I saw that they are breathing stuffed animals. The pink color tone creates a carnival midway atmosphere alongside the canal. The main attraction is the ice cream. I am talking a sundry of ice cream flavors that include: Checker Boys Rum Raisin, Coffee & Doughnuts, Mom's Apple Pie, & Scout's Honor. Where the seats are nil inside and far and few outside in the Square, the prices are exorbitant. The prices are so high for a couple of scoops, I would recommend splurging a few more dollars for a sundae. On my leading visit, I ordered the Peanut Butter Cup Sundae. At a price a few cents short of $10 after taxes, it included 3 scoops of peanut butter ice cream, generous amount of small peanut butter cups, hot Fudge, whipped cream, & a cherry in a plastic bowl. It was a high price that was a small price to pay for enjoying a delicious sundae in a Venice dreamscape. It was so delicious that I planned to end the staycation a few days later with the Strawberry Fields Ice Cream Soda. On the second visit that took place on Friday, May 4; I told their employee Elijah to make the ice cream soda with two scoops strawberry and 1 scoop strawberry cheesecake. I thought about ordering it on the first visit, however, they were out of strawberry ice cream. Upon exchanging $9.52 with the cashier, this was my expectation. However, when I stood by a chairless high table taking in the sight of gondolas passing by on the canal, my taste buds took in a disappointing ice cream soda. It started out delicious. The scoops of strawberry ice cream were out of this world delicious. However, when I progressed to the lower levels of the paper cup the Strawberry Fields met the swamp. First off the Strawberry cheesecake ice cream that I ordered was nonexistent. The biggest dunce ice cream soda moment in my life turning it into the crappiest ice cream soda that I ever set my teeth into was that it was made from Diet Pepsi. What ice cream server in their right mind uses Diet Pepsi as a base of an ice cream soda?! Yuck! It's like, \"yeah I'll take all the sugary ice cream, maybe whip cream, toppings, Fudge, and a Diet Pepsi.\" It was absolutely disgusting causing me to throw the rest away along with one star from the rating. What a disappointment! Although I was disappointed in the ice cream soda, there is potential for a return visit. Let's face it, how many ice cream parlors overlook a Venice Canal in Las Vegas? If I do return, I would stick to a sundae. Unlike an ice cream soda, I can visually see the ice cream. Most likely I will return to the Linq Promenade Ghirardelli Ice Parlor before returning here. In reality my dream come true of savoring ice cream overlooking a Venice Canal running through St. Marks Square in Las Vegas is not over. Just postponed indefinitely."

            "Located in the Eastern and 215 shopping center, Somi somi has taken over the old Rolled Ice cream space. We went on opening day and it was a little bit of a cluster, as you expect from opening day. But we've been there 4 times since their grand opening, a month ago, and they have definitely smoothed out the kinks and now is like a well oiled machine. Somi Somi is a Korean inspired dessert place. Their signature is the Taiyaki, which is a fish shaped pastry filled with a filling of your choice: cheddar, Nutella, custard, red bean, Taro and Oreo. Taiyakis are 2 for $3.95 or 5 for $7.95. The taiyaki are perfection. Crispy on the outside and chewy and perfect once you bite in. We chose the custard, Nutella, red bean and Oreo fillings. All were really good. The Oreo was a little dry as it's just an Oreo cookie broken in half and placed in the middle. We also ordered the Ahboong $5.95 which is soft serve with a fish cone on top. Soft serve flavors change out as they are seasonal. When we went we tried the matcha, Oreo and ube swirl. The soft serve was thick and creamy. Tasted so rich, like frozen custard. Sooo good! Mashisoyo. You can choose a filling to fill inside the Ahboong as well but we opted not to. Once your order is ready, you go to the pick up counter and can add complimentary toppings like a macaron shell, sprinkles or a fresh strawberry. So incredibly happy to have Somi Somi come down to the Henderson area. A great new and fresh addition to the sea of restaurants on Eastern. Check it out you will not be disappointed. There taiyaki is the best we've ever had.",
            "More like so yummy so yummy. SomiSomi is a growing chain of dessert-centric locations that just opened this 2nd outpost in the Las Vegas area. This one is located toward the middle of Sansone Park Place on the east side of Eastern near Richmar. If memory serves, it used to be a Rolled Ice Cream, which I predicted was due to fail because they just plain sucked. Fortunately, SomiSomi does not suck. If they offered just one of either the soft serve or the taiyaki, I would already be happy with them. Those who know/stalk me may be aware that I'm on a perpetual rant about how this hot desert doesn't seem to sustain dessert places, in particular ice cream / gelato. The milk tea / thai tea soft serve swirl (combinations will rotate, according to the menu) was delightful though, with plenty of flavor and creaminess. Free toppings can go a long way too, especially the crispy coconut flakes. The matcha powder was also nice, but be careful because wind or jostling may result in your clothing or car turning green. Just as enjoyable was their custard-filled taiyaki (which I ended up trying twice due to their free taiyaki w/ purchase grand opening promo). For their ahboong ($5.95), they serve a rounder, hollow fish; due to COVID policy, they merely invert this onto a cup of conical ice cream instead of filling the fish itself. To be clear, the taiyaki is a star because it's pretty much a fun-shaped waffle, and you can even watch them cook these waffles on their proprietary waffle iron. Crispy exterior and delightfully chewy interior (yes, I'm sure I've used that exact phrasing before, but it fits) are what you'll find with the taiyaki, as well as a sweet creamy filling of your choice. (Local dessert lovers or people who've known me will also recall that the Waffle Love food truck was amazing until it was kidnapped and gutted, then subsequently retired. Fortunately, we now we have a waffle that, while not in the same style, is also awesome in its own way.) I was silly silly to pass up on SomiSomi when I was near their location on Spring Mountain in Shanghai Plaza, but I'll be sure to avoid making that mistake in the future. Whether you're in Nevada or another state, these guys are worth going out of your way to try.",
            "I wasn't sure what to expect honestly, but I was in for a great surprise!! I ordered an upside down milk tea with custard. It was so delicious. We also ordered taiyaki with custard, cheese, and Nutella. The cheese was by far the winner!! I'd say it's like a fish shaped grilled cheese. I can't even rave enough about it. It was so simple but so good. I would definitely recommend this place. The stage is friendly. The place is bright and clean. Not a lot of seating so definitely good for take out.",
            "SomiSomi is serving up delicious soft serve and waffle cones in a unique way. This has been a long time bookmark for me and it was even better than I expected. The shop is bright and welcoming with cute art on the walls. The dining room is large, but right now only offers one standing bar style area. I'd love to see them return to offering tables for dine in. Without indoor tables I can't justify returning with my toddler in the dead of summer. They have a couple of picnic tables in front for outdoor seating. The service was friendly and our sweet treats were ready after only a few minutes. There are a variety ways to enjoy these treats. You can choose soft serve in a cup, soft serve in a cone, or a cup of soft serve with a cone on top. Then you choose a soft serve flavor. They offer specials with a twist of two flavors too. Then choose a filling for the cone. Lastly, when you pick up your treat you can choose toppings like a macaron, cereal, or candy. Cones can be purchased on their own too. For my treat I went with a cup of Ube soft serve topped with a cone filled with taro. To finish it I added a macaron and Fruity Pebbles. The soft serve was very creamy and not too sweet. The Fruity Pebbles sweetened it up a bit. The macaron was tasty. My favorite part was the fish shaped cone. It was a little crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside with a lovely flavor. The taro inside was enough to add something, but didn't overpower the cone. The serving of soft serve was too much for me to finish. If I return with my husband I would share one and add a couple of cones. There are other flavors that I look forward to trying. I'm excited to return when it's cool enough to eat outside!",
            "This place is so. stinkin'. CUTE! The interior elements really add to the aesthetic of the shop, like the fish scale panels with lighting, the wall art, the light colors with tall windows, allowing for a bright and airy feel - it's just so CUTE! The menu isn't anything extensive - it's a very niche business, but they do great at what they do. You can pick some Taiyaki, which are fish-shaped waffles (not flavored, shaped, lol) that have your choice of filling. My personal favorites are the Nutella, Cheese, and Oreo, in that order. You can also do a soft-serve, with rotating flavors and swirls (combos of two flavors), depending on the day. My daughter loved the oreo flavor, and the milk/thai tea swirl was delicious! You can also throw on an open-mouth taiyaki fish, also with your choice of filling, on top of the ice cream, and unfortunately they did not have the waffle fish that acts as the ice cream cone (yet, hopefully). You can then top your ice cream off with several different topping choices (oreo crumbles, matcha, sprinkles, etc.) with a strawberry or macaron on top. I've also tried their strawberry milk, which looked so pretty in the photos. It was good, and the strawberry chunks were fresh and yummy, but probably wouldn't get again. This is a family favorite and so accessible in the plaza - we'll be coming back here for sure!"

            "Ok so me and the Bestie decided to get something sweet. I myself am not a fan of cake or cupcakes but decided what the heck she recommends it let's try it. We entered the shop and it was cool clean and inviting. Although it took a little bit to be helped it wasn't a big deal as we were side tracked by yumminess. There is a wide variety of specialty and classic cupcakes. At first I thought to myself well I'll get chocolate since I love me some chocolate. As we step to the counter to order the lady behind takes my friends order which gave me a last opportunity to look at the menu. I will tell you I became so excited that I yelled out \"OMG THEY SERVE JUST FROSTING!!!!\" My friend laughed because I was so excited and the lady just smiled like someone's happy. My apologies to the couple who walked in at that exact moment lol. Anywho I decided to ask the lady just to make sure the menu was right . She said yes we do serve just the frosting. With wide eyes I said please give me two chocolate with sprinkles!!! For this reason alone this place has become my number 1 spot to return to. It's nice to know that I wasn't judged because I don't like cake. Most places I go people say what's wrong with you that you don't like cake! I didn't get a snicker or weird look like I normally so so that right there made me beyond happy. The other reason is because the little cups of frosting are on lyrics 75 cents a piece. So it's a total win win. So the only thing I can't give a review on is how the actual cupcakes taste. But my friend did say that she and her co-workers love them. So if the locals love them so do I!! So if you don't like cake definitely go here!!",
            "We are at Linq all the time so we finally gave in to the Sprinkles hype. I have always been tempted by them when in LA and I'm honestly excited to see such an icon business come to our city. (yes I can't wait for Fred Segal either) Disclosure: I'm not a cupcake fan and hubby really never eats sweets. Oh and we only have one choice here. Vegan red velvet. Wait....I don't even like red velvet! I got over it and stepped in to the bright world of Sprinkles on the cupcake side, I'll have to try their sorbet next time, and was greeted by three lovely ladies. They tiny place was getting packed and we even tried to use the cupcake ATM but they only stock certain ones in there. Darn because hubby was excited to use it. The ladies asked us what we would like and asked us if we had any questions or needed suggestions to match what we were craving or favored. We knew what we wanted and they told us to move over to the pay area that it's coming right out. Appeared another young lady and it was the manager welcoming us :) she actually was excited because her hair used to be the same lavender as mine and she wishes she still had it lol. Honestly she would look super fab in there with all that pink and that cute hair........anyway...she thanked us for coming in and gave us her card. She told is to say hi next time we were in. Cool. I never expected all the service that we got here within two minutes of stepping in the door. Our V red velvet came out and they gave us a napkin and offered us a fork and knife to split it. Like a good register girl she asked us if we would be needing anything to drink with our CC and the upsell worked because I needed water. Grabbed our items and were thanked again and we headed to an outside table that someone was getting up from. The Linq patios are an awesome people watching area and whenever I sit at any tables down that drag it's always quite a treat. The cupcake was soft, moist and slightly warm, not sure how that's possible because I doubt they were making these fresh. Maybe? But it was honestly the best CC I have had in a long time. Why? Because it was like a piece of chocolate cake. Don't ask me how or why, I don't ever bake. Rich and moist and the icing was creamy, rich and sweet. I guess we got a good one but I would think this place would be consistent. Lots of people are CC experts and they like all those raspberry chocolate souffl\u00c3\u00a9 ganache bs.....we are happy with simple. Less ingredients to figure out what you just put in your mouth. So for a CC and a bottle water it was right around $5? and I thought it was a great deal. The simple experience and charm of the place, the staff, people watching, and the cupcake was a small slow bliss moment in this busy life. I'm sold. But this is also a once every few months indulgence. So slow down, hold hands with your sweetie, grab a cupcake, and sit down to people watch. Enjoy life.",
            "I'm so glad that this place opened up in the Linq! Such a wonderful cupcake joint which as stirred up a lot of buzz since the grand opening. Since it's opened, I've been to this place 4 times. That says a lot as I'm not a sweets type of person. Here's what I thought: The set up: I love the set up! When you enter the place, you'll notice the ice cream shop to the right and the cupcakes to the left. If the joint is busy, no worries! Make your way outside to the cupcake ATM! What an awesome device :) Give you the power to eat cupcakes at any time. Service: The staff is a younger crowd for sure. For the most part they are super personable and really accommodating. On one of my visits though, I was super turned off by how immature some of them were acting. We understand as customers, that the cupcakes run out. It was kind of unprofessional for two employees to be fighting over the last cupcake for their customer. Prices: I'm not sure about the ice cream prices, but if you choose to go to the cupcake side, they have 2 prices: $3.75 for large cupcakes and $2.00 for small cupcakes. Selection: The selection is on point! There are a lot of different flavors. Over the course of 4 visits, I've tried a few different flavors. Here's what I thought: -Triple Cinnamon: By far, my absolute favorite! The cake was light, the cream cheese frosting was not dense and filled with the cinnamon flavor and topped with cinnamon sugar. So delicious! Watch out, they go fast! -Red Velvet: Their best seller for sure. The cake was a little more dense than I expected but I can see why it's a best seller! - Smores: Cool cupcake! The frosting is a marshmallow texture, chocolate cake with a graham cracker bottom. All the elements are there and well received! -Peanut Butter Chip: Super dense cake with an intense peanut butter taste. I like the chocolate chips throughout the cupcake and the peanut butter frosting reinforced the flavor. -Dark Chocolate: WOW, lots of chocolate going on! Super rich and decadent. If you're a chocolate lover, this cupcake is perfect for you! - Mini chocolate marshmallow: Rich chocolate ganache frosting, chocolate cake with marshmallow filling. Nice combination of flavors :) Sprinkles has taken an American classic and took it to the next level. The prices might be a little steep but man, I think it's super worth it! When a place put a lot of time and effort in making each dessert, you can't help but overlook the bill. I will be the first one to admit that I will not only return, I will also admit that I will be enjoying more than one cupcake each and every time. Thanks so much for deciding to open in Las Vegas!",
            "Let's get our sprinkle and sparkle on. Cream cheese frosting. Can you taste your favorite flavor, long for that soft fluffy sweetness. Cupcakes and ice cream in one place all together. Cupcakes will one day be the best way to celebrate our difficult differences. Decisions will be decided. Those that are in power must realize that the cylindrical shaped cups of love are way to powerful to resist. These treasured delights are the moments that are full of such harmony. Happiness can be achieved over coffee, tea, and cupcakes; period. The human race just needs to come to this realization before it's too late. So many delicious flavors and varieties could be achieved. When will they learn. Let's start the lesson without those individuals. We're talking cupcakes today, name the flavor and it's here. Deliciousness in a cylindrical culinary crush. Just walk through the door and let's start the process of ordering. The cupcakes are baked fresh here on sight each and every morning. The crew that calls this \"work\" knows that their company supports so many great causes and their ultimate happiness as equal human beings in all walks of life. Last month, June 2019 was Pride month. The whole month Sprinkles had a special cupcake just for this special occasion. They offered by special order an eight tier rainbow cake done just for pride month too. Companies that dedicate this much support to special causes are trying to make the world a better place. It's July 2019, Sprinkles is celebrating America's birthday with cupcakes that are red, white, and blue. They should be called Freedom cakes, but the causes that the company celebrates is authentic and geared towards many choices for all individuals to enjoy. The cupcakes always deliver here, never have I had a \"bad\" cupcake from any Sprinkles anywhere. This particular location is located on the board walk near the Linq Ferris wheel. A prime local right next to In and Out, by the large fountain in the court yard by the Flamingo Hotel and Casino. It's not easily allowable accessibility by car, but their is ample parking out by the Linq hotel. Unfortunately the parking for the Linq is no longer complimentary. The Flamingo Hotels parking garage is your best bet which is free. Now using the Valet at the Flamingo is costly. Either way you make your way to this Sprinkles it's worth the cost. Make a day out of it. Come for In and Out yummy burgers, then have cupcakes from Sprinkles for dessert. Come love one another, hand and hand, spread your love and beauty around. Embrace what it means to be accepted, no matter what your race, gender, sex, or other disposition in life. Let the pride of the rainbow embrace thee and wrap its spirit around your soul. Come soar with us, know your potential has no limits. Let you have no boundaries to soar high above all. Become whatever your soul and psyche beckon to you. You are special no matter whom you are. Let no one ever steal your light. Always remember that kindness should be in heart and love light the way.",
            "Frankly, I don't even know about all the hype or the national fame or whatever. I just went here on a friend's recommendation (and with a bunch of other people, but that's not so relevant). Sprinkles is next to a plaza of sorts within the Linq. I think the easiest parking is probably the giant outdoor lot on Winnick Rd. off Koval, and when you walk through that end of the Linq, you'll get a good view of the giant ferris wheel. The store is pretty nicely decorated, brightly lit, and clean so far. Aside from just following up on the recommendation, the crux of my visit was to capitalize on a sort of BOGO offer: buy a Cuban coffee cupcake ($3.75, standard price), whisper a secret passphrase (out of respect and because this is time-limited, I'll just say that it's on the national Sprinkles Facebook page), and get any other cupcake free. I chose dark chocolate on aforementioned friend's recommendation. Funny thing about a place named Sprinkles. They never asked me whether I wanted sprinkles on my cupcake. Only later did I learn that not only do the sprinkles not come by default (even though they're free), but the dark chocolate cupcake may be even better with the sprinkles, which are apparently more like flakes. Also, it seems that it's not the same person who takes your order as the one who takes payment, so I had to do that passphrase thing twice, which speaks to more communication issues. But let's end this on a positive trend: if you have a sweet tooth, you will love these guys. Cuban coffee was delicious, with the coffee flavor concentrated in the lovely frosting. Dark chocolate was also great, and definitely not too sweet (at least in the non-sprinkle form). And I got to try a bit of a lemon cupcake which was just vibrant with flavor. Good times."

            "***Sweet Republic features a wide variety of good ice cream flavors (both traditional flavors and unique ones); this gourmet ice cream parlor also delivers their ice cream into all kinds of desserts including sundaes and shakes; housemade goodies like marshmallows and almond toffee brittle are also available*** Sweet Republic is a gourmet ice cream shop in Scottsdale. This store has a wide variety of ice cream flavors and there are more traditional flavors like chocolate and mint, but there are several unique flavors too like sweet corn and honey blue cheese. Sweet Republic is not simply ice cream in a cup or cone though. This shop also features their ice cream in many different types of desserts like sundaes, shakes and ice cream sandwiches. Other items are available too like nostalgic candy and several housemade goodies that make for nice gifts--like packaged bags of bacon brittle, almond toffee brittle and marshmallows. I tried several of their ice cream flavors. I felt their traditional flavors were decent like Belgian chocolate and salted butter caramel. My favorite flavor I had was their sweet corn. It had a great and very noticeable corn flavor. The consistency of the ice cream was very good. The ice cream was thick and dense as well as very smooth and creamy (with no trace of iciness). The sweet corn did have a few corn kernels mixed into the ice cream, which I thought was unnecessary; it kind of distracted from the very even smoothness of the ice cream. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sweet-republic-scottsdale-2?select=C6qJQ4XVXg3oLRDG38a1ww#I9lsd_IyLbyYzhAlDh0MEg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/swee\u00a6</a> I also tried one of their sundaes, Toffee Banofi, which was featured on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate. The sundae consisted of two scoops of their Madagascar vanilla ice cream, which was topped with fresh banana, almond toffee brittle, whipped cream, and salted butter caramel sauce. Everything went together very well and all of the toppings were good. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sweet-republic-scottsdale-2?select=C6qJQ4XVXg3oLRDG38a1ww#RreFW96E2_qZMqBPo0rglw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/swee\u00a6</a> The only topping to really stand out though was the almond toffee brittle. It had a great crunch and crispness from both the whole almonds and the brittle. The flavor was very good too--a very nice burnt caramel flavor that was definitely robust and strong without being too bitter. Service was good--pleasant, polite and quick. The store has a very nice interior. It is a pretty big space with a decent amount of seating. The store has a few nice decor touches throughout the room. The decor is not as charming as some of the upscale artisan ice cream shops I have been to, but it is still good and nicer than most ice cream parlors. Prices on the sundaes are pretty expensive. Ice cream by the scoop here is not too pricey though Sweet Republic's prices are similar to other gourmet ice cream shops in big cities. I enjoyed both the ice cream and sundae at Sweet Republic. The flavors were good and the consistency had the thickness, firmness, density, and smoothness that you just do not get at a lot of the major mass market ice cream parlors. I think the flavors are more distinct at ice cream shops like Sweet Rose Creamery (in Brentwood), Carmela (in Pasadena) and Jeni's (in Ohio), but Sweet Republic is definitely worth visiting if you are an ice cream fan and find yourself in the Phoenix or Scottsdale area. Sweet Republic is located in a retail plaza that has its own free parking lot. It is easy finding an open space.",
            "Like many other reviewers, I know Sweet Republic's owners (fellow Yelper, Helen Y. and Jan). Knowing them may have been what made my husband (Myles M) and me drive all the way up from South Phoenix to North Scottsdale, but knowing them would not make me give them an unwarranted 5-star rating. I have high standards for my food and drink, so I can guarantee you that my 5-star rating of Sweet Republic's is 100% genuine. Good cuisine always places a huge focus on two things: 1) using fresh, high-quality ingredients; and 2) combining these ingredients in a simple, thoughtful way that maximizes the individual flavors (think \"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts\"). Based on this definition, Sweet Republic makes great food that just happens to be ice cream. All of the ice creams, sorbets, and yogurts use ultra-fresh and natural ingredients (e.g., fresh mint, locally-roasted espresso, wild desert honey, handmade marshmallows) and the flavors thoughtfully combine ingredients that really go well together (e.g., pear and ginger, basil and lime, blue cheese and dates, blueberry and orange). Helen and Jan know what goes well together, too, and they will be happy to suggest flavor combinations of the different ice creams that work well together. When I started to order the Cheese Course flavor with Rocky Road, simply because those two flavors sounded the best to me, Jan suggested that I pair the Cheese Course with a fruit flavor. I took her advice, paired it with the Pear Ginger, and the cool, subtle sweetness of the pear and ginger flavors did wonders to cut the strong blue cheese flavor. I felt like I should have had a glass of wine to go with my cheese and fruit! My husband ended up ordering the Rocky Road with the Salted Caramel, which was by far my favorite flavor, and these two also paired wonderfully. We also had an opportunity to try the bacon ice cream, which was sweet and salty at the same time. If it sounds weird, just think of how great bacon tastes when it rubs up against your pancakes and gets maple syrup on it! I always value an establishment's food and drink more than decor, presentation, etc., but in the case of Sweet Republic, the same attention and care paid to the sweets is also paid to the establishment's look, branding, and messaging, which only adds to the business' appeal. The shop is decorated in a bright, modern decor that manages not to look cookie-cutter in a sea of Ikea-decorated shops, the bathrooms are designed beautifully and are super clean, the menu is attractive and easy to read, and the website is well-written and contains all the pertinent information. This is a great, local business whose owners care about making fresh, flavorful, and thoughtful ice creams and other desserts. I'm glad I met them and therefore had the incentive to go check it out. You should, too!",
            "Yes, Sweet Republic is as good if not better than all 240 Yelp reviews say it is. The ice cream is creamy, it's light, it's fluffy, it's addicting and it's really just everything you think about in an ice cream. The other reviews explain the ice cream to the core, so I won't go too into detail about the flavors, but I will say that my two favorites for now are the chocolate brownie and of course, the salted Carmel. Put them together and it's definitely 'ice cream-you-scream-we-all-scream-for-Sweet Republic-ice cream-sweetness.' Here's another special treat to Sweet Republic. Their heavenly toffee! It could be the best toffee I've ever had. In fact, I think I'm going to deem it the best toffee I've had to-date. The almond toffee is buttery, crunchy and soft all together. I put it on top of my salted Carmel ice cream, forgot about every calorie I was consuming and enjoyed sweet moments of Sweet Republic bliss. The bacon brittle intrigued me and I must say, I wasn't too eager to try it. But, after reading about it so often, I had to give it a whirl and was happily surprised! The bacon taste definitely overtakes the taste of the toffee making it taste like you are eating bacon with an infused taste of left-over syrup from your pancakes. Actually, I bet it would taste pretty good on top of waffles or pancakes! So with that, I will end the 241st review of Sweet Republic. This is a friendly, fresh and delicious business located so randomly in the middle of a mini shopping complex off of Shea and I'm so proud that this local Scottsdale business has gotten so much recognition. Live and love local in the land of cacti!",
            "Sweet Republic is seriously amazing. I have high standards for frozen dairy treats, and Sweet Republic is waaayy up there! I was drawn to this place after learning about their unique artisan ice cream flavors: Blue Cheese Honey, Sweet Corn, Real Mint, Maple Pecan ... plus housemade marshmallows - YUM! I was finally able to convince my hubby to make the pilgrimage because they are (incredibly) open until 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays, which makes it the perfect late night date spot :) The shop is supercute, decor is contemporary and cheerful, with unique lighting fixtures. The tables are lined up along a banquette on the side of the restaurant - again, very date friendly! You can cozy up with your significant other while savoring some yummy icecreamy goodness. They have a stack of board games at the back of the restaurant, which I thought was a nice touch as well - how fun to get some delicious icecream while playing Connect Four with a friend? The menu is excellent: from the icecreams themselves to the sundae options and awesome toppings, you really can't go wrong. I went in expecting to order the Campfire S'More Sundae, but made a rogue move at the last moment and switched over to the Pecan Turtle Sundae in a waffle cup... omgoodness, so, so GREAT. Before settling on my sundae, I did get a quick sample of the Plum Verbena icecream and wow - light, refreshing, and unique - definitely a good pick if you're in the mood for a scoop or two. Now, back to the Pecan Turtle Sundae: I've had lots of Turtle Sundaes and this one was just head and shoulders above anything else I've ever tasted. I seriously dreamed about it from the time I left Sweet Republic until the following weekend, when we returned so that I could have it again (and share it with my Grandmother, who is a fellow appreciator of a good frozen treat!) The sundae is topped with hot fudge and salted caramel sauce, fresh whipped cream, and pecans that are toasted/transformed into little nuggets of greatness. The waffle bowl was the crowning glory: sweet, crispy, crunchy and delicious - be sure to get one :) My husband ordered the Cookie Mintifesto and he loved it, although I wasn't a huge fan of the \"real\" mint - I prefer fake mint, I guess :) It was pretty \"brisk\" and not very sweet. My son tried the Honey Blue Cheese on our second visit and was smacking his lips and \"mmm-mmm\"ing the whole time. Service was alright - the sundaes take a bit of time to make and when they're busy, the employees seem stressed. I can't recommend Sweet Republic enough as a must-try destination in itself, but it will also become an \"anytime\" place that you'll find yourself headed to every opportunity you have.",
            "(Lyrics - Neil Diamond - Sweet Caroline) Where to begin, I can begin with milkshakes But then I know my appetite is growing strong Start with a scoop And the scoop became a double Who'd have believed it came along Hot.....fudge sundaes..... Reaching out, trying it, tasting it...... Sweet Republic (bop bop bop) Good times never seemed so good I'd be inclined (bop bop bop) To believe it never would Now Bo Bites..... How shall I start! I love Ice Cream!? Well let's just say I'm one to have a sweet spot for some good ice cream! Sweet Republic has that covered ladies and gents. With funky flavors such as Kulfi, Jalapeno Avocado Bacon Brittle, Basil Lime Sorbet, etc. Sweet Republic has 2 locations I hope this little ice cream boutique grows, even though the Shea location is close enough for me to visit more often than not. However, my gut and love handles say NO MORE! My mouth and eyes say just a small bite of Waffle cones and 2 more flavors! They also serve up some interesting milkshakes and sundaes, which I can't wait to try! Your ice cream could be served up in a waffle cone, cup, and even between 2 cookies of your choice! I came here on a hot summer day and ordered the waffle cone with Salted Caramel Butter and Belgium Chocolate. I'm not too crazy for the exotic flavors; like to keep things simple. Sweet and buttery ice cream slow oozing down my cone as I embrace every bite and lick.....gee I think I just had a foodgasm! Overall, the place is very welcoming like most ice cream shops. It can get real crammed up in this shop since seating is limited, but lets just hope you beat out the crowd. In the end, Sweet Republic's reputation is definitely well deserved and a must visit! - Enjoy"

            "I had been absolutely DYING to try a bakery in West Charlotte, the Batchmaker Batch House, but the hours make it difficult for me to get here. They're only open while supplies last, between 8 AM and 3 PM, Tuesday-Saturday. When you work weekdays (like I do), the hours are not conducive to getting here! If they opened an hour earlier, I could get here more regularly. Until then, Saturdays are my only shot at making it in. It's a very limited menu, too, except on Saturdays when they showcase a wide array of goods. They WILL sell out though, so I highly recommend getting here as early as possible! This small little shop features a menu of rotating sweet treats throughout the week. There are a couple of tables outside the shop, and if it weren't for COVID, I'd love to sit in the super-cute, midcentury styled seating area inside -- complete with sofa, accent chair, a few tables, and a small bar you can work from (or simply sit and enjoy a snack). Alas, only two people are currently allowed in at a time. I love that the owner is 100% self-taught with no formal training. It makes the bakery feel more real and community-driven. I had no formal training when I worked as a chef, so I admire its owner. Heck, maybe I'll apply for a weekend job. Trade a few secrets as something to do. When I went, the service was extremely slow. It took a solid 10-15 minutes per customer, and when only two people are allowed in at a time due to COVID, the line moves at a snail's pace. I arrived at 9 AM, and it took about 40 minutes for me to get inside. The line only continued to build up behind me. I HIGHLY recommend you get there for opening, and just know that there is no \"running in\" for a quick treat here. Here's what I ordered: Tres Leches Draft Iced Latte. They partnered with Hex Coffee in Charlotte to offer this draft latte. It's on tap and tastes more like a dessert than a coffee. It's creamy, sweet, and delicious -- with just a hint of coffee. I TOTALLY recommend it! S'mores Cupcake. I have mixed feelings about this. Overall, it was one of my favorite things I tried. The chocolate cake was PERFECTION! It was fluffy, moist, and chocolatey... what's not to love? The marshmallow was great too. The one negative for me is that the frosting was too sweet -- like so sweet you think your teeth might fall out. If the frosting were a marshmallow frosting that was then garnished with a fancily designed graham cracker, this would be my go-to every time. I can't stop thinking about how good the chocolate cake portion was! Oatmeal Cream Pie. This is what the bakery is famous for. It's like a \"Little Debbie Oatmeal Cr\u00c3\u00a8me Pie\" but SOOOO MUCH BETTER. I find the Little Debbie one sickly sweet (like the frosting from the S'mores cupcake). The Oatmeal Cream Pie at Batchmaker is heavenly. It has insanely good vanilla and marshmallow filling that oozes out in the best way possible. This was my favorite thing I tried -- and quite frankly, if the line weren't so long, I would have gone back inside for another one. Pro tip: Sometimes, they offer a variation where they put the filling between two Oreo Truffle Cookies, which has to be INSANELY GOOD. Oreo Truffle Cookie. This is an excellent cookie. I love Oreos, and this was a whole new level of deliciousness. It's chewy with a slight Oreo/slight vanilla flavor. It's sweet but much more subdued than an Oreo is. I'd call this perfection. If you like Oreos, these are DEFINITELY worth a try. Cinnamon Coffee Cake. This was good, but a disappointment compared to everything else. Don't get me wrong; it's a knock-out for coffee cake -- it's soft, moist, and has just the right amount of cinnamon. Everything else was just so dang good; this felt a bit boring. Caramel Scone. Perhaps it was caramel apple? It tasted like a delicious apple pie, so I think there was apple in it -- but maybe my brain was playing tricks on me. I can't find it on their menu, and it didn't have a sign when I was there, so maybe I imagined it... Anyhow... it's terrific if they do have it available when you visit. Turtle Cookie. These are BRAND NEW to the menu. It's a chocolate cookie covered in caramel and topped with sea salt and a pecan. It was delicious! And definitely more chocolatey than the caramel and pecan flavor of a traditional turtle. If you're looking for something soft and chewy, this is your YUM! Strawberry Pop Tart. THANK GOD real pop tarts don't taste like this -- I'd quickly be on the way to \"my 500lb life.\" This deliciously flakey pastry is almost a pie crust with a slight sweetness: it's a perfect pop tart. They make a few other flavors too, like blueberry, brown sugar, and PB+J (all of which I need to try). S'mores Brownie. I paid for this; however, they forgot to put it in my box. After I got home, I reached out to them when I realized it was missing, and they were super sweet and embarrassed about it. Next time I come in, they'll give me the one I paid for, plus another to make up for it!",
            "I had heard about The Batchmaker and her desserts for awhile from friends during quarantine of 2020 and I thought, \"man, I wish I had known about her sooner to try the desserts!\" Then when I heard she was reopening a store front I knew I had to go to her grand re-opening. I got there early-ish and waited in line for about 45 minutes. Not horrible if you ask me. I've waited in 2 hour lines for food before, so no big deal. Before we get to the dessert, let me start by saying the inside of the new shop was very cute and quaint. Has a cute high tea feel to it from the furniture to the delicate dishes on display behind the counter. The love for the Golden Girls is apparent when you step into the restroom and I am HERE FOR IT Cris (owner and baker) even has a little kitchen for the tiny customers/junior bakers in the making! It's all adorable. Now to the desserts... I got the following: - Apple roll - DELICIOUS! The roll itself wasn't overly sweet which balanced out the sweetness from the frosting. The apples were delicious and still had a nice bite/crunch to them, which I always appreciate. - Oatmeal creme pies - I love a good oatmeal cookie and these were very good. Again, the cookie balanced out the sweetness of the creme which has a subtle marshmallow flavor. - Apple caramel cookie - Also delicious! - Cookie butter cookie - I love cookie butter and this mixed with the chocolate chunks was so good!!! So far, there wasn't anything that wasn't delicious. Another thing I noticed while visiting was the genuine love that Cris has for her work and the customers that support her. Asked vice versa. The customers (new and returning) were so supportive and there was so much love.",
            "I wish I could give them 10 stars! The Batchhouse not only continually and consistently gives us amazingly delicious treats, but the team behind this gem creates the most special and sincere environment for everyone to enjoy. From the smiles that greet you on entry to the beautiful interior, it's the perfect spot to enjoy the BEST goodies in Charlotte. Cris really does put her heart in all her recipes and it shows! Thank you Batchhouse for working so hard and giving us the best of the best! Some of my personal faves: Oreo truffle cookies, s'mores cake, dulce de leche brownies, oatmeal cream pies, and their cold brew!",
            "Took a trip from NYC to Charlotte to visit friends. I've been following the batch maker, for a while now. I was super excited to go and try it out. Also, very happy that the case was stocked !! The setting is very cute and super cozy. The china that they use is to die for. Me and friends all grab some treats, to enjoy. The Banana Nutella bread, the cereal muffins, OCP, and s'mores brownies. The best out of all was the banana bread, although it was a bit too sweet. The latte that I had did help cut back the sweetness. I hope they get a microwave or a toaster. I felt like some of the thing would have been better warmer up. Like the S'more brownie, would have been amazing if it was warmed up. The texture of the cold set marshmallow was a bit off for me. The OCP, was my least favorite. The cookie itself was not the best. The filling was too sweet, and felt a bit chalky. Overall, a super cute spot and friendly staff.",
            "There are times my wife and I need to finish our night with a treat. One place we love to either get a treat to end our night or to have with our morning coffee is batchmaker. This place has great homemade baked goods and the owner and staff are such nice and friendly people. We have had the pop tarts (both apple cinnamon and strawberry), the oatmeal cream pie, their brownies, cereal killer muffins with cereal cooked inside. We have loved everything. My wife's favorite is the oatmeal cream pie and mine is the pop tart. They also serve coffee from my favorite local coffee shop, Hex/stable hand. So, two great local spots collaborating is also a big win for us all. Good people, great food and great drinks is what local shopping is all about. I would recommend this place to all sweet connoisseurs."

            "My original review of this place is below, which I wrote while I was sitting in the bakery. I had given it 4 stars and some really nice comments, but felt I should update it after the rest of my experience here. I've truly never had such an upsetting experience at any business in my life. In the review I had said the worker was \"seemingly\" condescending, implying that her attitude might not have been intentional and trying to give her the benefit of the doubt while she was rolling her eyes at me while I decided between the desserts. She had read my review while I was in the bakery (which is fine although she pointed out how \"obvious\" it was that I was writing it as if I was trying to hide it). She brought my coffee to me and said \"Here you go, Jasmine\" making a point that she had seen my review, as I hadn't told her my name and didn't use a card to pay. She went back to the counter and got on her phone. About ten minutes later, two of her friends came in, went to the counter and began quoting my review out loud while saying things like \"how dumb is this person, it's actually hilarious\" The girl working said \"like I actually want to show them this review we literally do not care what people say on Yelp like I should frame that and hang it up here.\" Which is interesting because I'm pretty sure reviews are for other possible guests, not to hurt some 20 year old worker's feelings... They continued to talk about about me loud and clear enough so I could hear them from the other side of the room saying: \"We came down here as fast as we could when we saw this. I read it on the way down it actually made me laugh.\" \"Is that her right there?? Ohh my...\" \"I could tell she was writing it like its so obvious when people are doing it.\" After 15 minutes of this, I went up to the girl and said \"Okay, as you clearly want since you've been standing up here intentionally talking about me, I'm leaving. Just so you understand, that review was not written as a personal jab at you, it was written to help other customers and the business which is why I gave it 4 stars. I intentionally didn't use a description of you or gender because I didn't want to pinpoint a certain person.\" As I said this, the three of them were mimicking my body language and chuckling to themselves...it was like watching 7th graders interact on a playground. As I walked out the door the girl yelled \"it's okay guys, some people are just miserable.\" So I guess by giving a business 4 stars and an honest review, I'm a miserable person (which by this point yeah I probably was). I also thought it was interesting that she was \"figuring out\" I was the one that wrote the review...if I was trying to hide who I was, I probably wouldn't have gone around taking pictures and wrote the review while I was sitting there.. I work in a restaurant myself, I do my best to be an understanding and friendly customer, I know how it feels when a customer upsets you. I just can't believe anyone would think its okay to treat any person like this, let alone when they're representing a business. I had sent texts out to my friends and family telling them to try this place at first, but naturally I've taken that back. Enjoy reading this review you don't care about, darling! ORIGINAL REVIEW: \"Nice atmosphere, decent espresso drinks, DELICIOUS desserts! Cozy, relaxed, Victorian style atmosphere that makes you feel right at home. Seems to usually be about 6 deserts at a time, with vegan options as well! I had a slice of salted caramel chocolate cake that was so big and rich I had to take some home! Limited espresso menu--no flavors or milk options, but my cappuccino was made well. My only complaint was the person working at the time wasn't the most friendly person in the world--not sure if they were the owner or just a worker, but they definitely didn't seem happy to have a new customer as they were short and seemingly condescending. Kind of a turnoff, but the place is so nice in itself I will most likely return!\"",
            "Oh, Butterwood. Where to begin? First, the cakes. They are inventive, delicious, and beautiful. They usually offer at least 4-5 different buttercream cakes, in addition to some staples, like browned butter blondies (which are VERY good - it's hard for me to walk out of here without one) and vegan chocolate pudding. There are always at least a couple of vegan options, which I shied away from for awhile because I love butter and dairy. But damn was I missing out! Today I had a vegan almond chocolate raspberry cake, and it was basically the best vegan dessert I have ever had. Trust me - you will not miss the dairy! The buttercream cakes are beautifully crafted, often topped with decorative herbs and flowers. If you check out their Instagram, you'll see that I'm not joking about the beautiful part. The slices are large - I would recommend splitting one with a friend! Cake flavors are always rotating, but there is almost always something for chocolate lovers and almond lovers. Flavors like lemon, lavender, and matcha make frequent appearances. It is important to know that Butterwood's cakes are dense. If you are a fluffy/airy cake person, consider yourself warned. I love my cakes dense and moist, so the ones here are perfect for me. The buttercream tends to be a little sweet for my personal tastes, but it's certainly not overly sweet compared to almost every other bakery out there. For this reason, I usually get other desserts, like blondies and pound cakes. By the way, if you think you hate pound cake because you grew up eating those ones from the supermarket, you must try the ones here. One bite will lead you to revise your idea of what pound cake even is -- or can be, anyway. On top of all that, they serve up KLVN coffee, beans that are not only local but deliciously roasted. The decor is charmingly Victorian, which makes for a very unique ambiance - equally pleasant for enjoying cake with friends or hanging out and working on your laptop. And they are friendly to well behaved dogs... apparently even the vegan dog treats are amazing, because at this point my dog will NOT let me walk past the shopfront without going in!",
            "This place is SO darling! So unique. Such a fun addition to Lawrenceville. A \"dessert caf\u00c3\u00a9\", I've only ever popped in and gotten stuff to go, but plan a visit to enjoy their fabulous desserts, coffee, and tea inside. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor is so fun, they have an array of eclectic chairs, velour couches, and tables for dining, drinking and relaxing, and a tiny little outside area with a few tables as well. Closed Monday & Tuesday, the rest of the weekdays they're open noon until 11 PM - open late, love it! Perfect for post-dinner dessert and tea. Weekend hours they open at 10 AM and close a little earlier. If you're in or around Lawrenceville, definitely add a visit here to the top of your list. Their desserts are truly SO decadent and delicious. They use only organic Daisy flour, Wholesome Sweeteners sugar, and local organic eggs. Their display case is always full of the most gorgeous cookies, cakes, cupcakes, bars, etc., always with vegan and non-vegan options, and sometimes gluten free as well. I mean....it can't get better than this! And you can truly tell they use quality ingredients because the look, taste and feel is topnotch. They do custom cake ordering as well. Two recent standout desserts include the vegan lavender cake with buttercream icing, and the vegan chocolate cupcake with peanut butter icing...wow. My boyfriend's go-to is the Blondie bar...so good. Treat yourself next time you're in the neighborhood, you will not regret it!",
            "I've known of The Butterwood Bake Consortium for quite a long time, but as a South Hills girl, this particular spot is a bit out of my way. Finally, I remembered to poke my head in and pick up some treats when I was passing through the area this weekend. Obviously I couldn't enjoy the full Butterwood experience in 2020, but I got to enjoy the important part: the cake! Butterwood is a dessert cafe, meaning they specialize in some of our favorite sweets - think cake, pie, and brownies. Coffee and tea are also served here, so in any year other than 2020, this would be the greatest spot to meet up with friends and catch up. While the dine-in experience is hard/impossible to enjoy right now for reasons beyond Butterwood's control, I can confirm that their desserts are still fabulous. I recently picked up several tea cakes to take home and sample. One was a lavender rose cake with fig buttercream; another was a dark chocolate cake with peanut butter buttercream; and the last was a ginger tea cake. The ginger cake, while good, was actually the \"disappointing\" one out of the bunch (I use the term loosely because again: all were good). I say that because chocolate and peanut butter always go well together and because the lavender-rose-fig combo is out of this world delicious. I did not expect that one to be my favorite, but here we are! A little more about the cake here: on their website they say, \"We bake with organic Beehive Flour, Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Multiple Organics Brand Cocoa Powder, and local butter, cream, and organic eggs, all sourced from Frankferd Farms Organic Foods.\" Sounds good, right? Bonus points because Butterwood also serves up gluten-free desserts; in fact, my friends who eat gluten-free diets are the people who sing the loudest praise for this little cafe. While 2020 has sadly kept me from comfortably sitting and enjoying the full cozy cafe experience, Butterwood's baked goods are still fantastic and can always be enjoyed at home. Treat yourself this holiday season and stop in to pick up a delectable dessert - you won't be disappointed!",
            "I stopped by with two friends a couple of weeks ago on a Sat. evening. Given that we were looking to get together later in the evening for hot beverages or dessert, Butterwood fit the bill, so we headed over to L-ville to check it out. Because their specialty is clearly cake and there weren't many other desserts in the case, we each ordered a slice of cake ($6 + tax each). Going against my usual adventurous streak when it comes to edibles, I decided to play it safe and stick with the chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream icing. The cake was velvety in texture, but not quite as most as I was hoping, and it was rather stiff on the iced side. As for the icing, it was definitely the best part of the cake--it was decadently creamy and rich, as buttercream should be. My friends ordered the chocolate pistachio cake and the vanilla poppy seed cake, and I tried bites of both. The cake component of the chocolate pistachio seemed identical to my chocolate cake, but the icing was saltier than mine with a rather muted pistachio taste. The vanilla poppy seed was the most interesting of the bunch, consisting of yellow cake and tangy vanilla icing sprinkled generously with poppy seeds. As others have mentioned, the slices were rather large, such that neither of my friends entirely finished theirs (as usual, I unabashedly housed my entire slice, however). If you visit and don't see a cake that you'd enjoy, I'd recommend waiting a bit and checking back, given that the cakes seem to rotate. By the time that we left, all of the cakes that'd been available when we ordered had been replaced by different types of cakes (hello, Meyer lemon cake!). The atmosphere is quaint, making it an ideal setting in which to relax and catch up over dessert and/or hot beverages. If you're a night owl and/or a fan of dessert, I definitely recommend checking it out--your inner Martha Stewart will definitely be pleased!"

            "I first saw this place posted on IG and couldn't wait to try it. My sweet tooth is something serious lol Location: In a blue building that says south end eats. You would definitely miss it if you aren't paying attention. This is a place you can sit down to eat . This is a take out spot only that houses multiple business. Order: you have the option to order online or order inside at the kiosk. Highly recommend ordering online to avoid a long wait. It took about 20mins for me to get my order. Parking: There is a small lot in front of the South End Eats building. My order: Peach Cobbler you don't get much for $8 but it was worth trying . It was lukewarm at best. It had a nice crust to cobbler ratio (if you know you know). The taste was good. 3.5/5 I wasn't aware of this place was takeout only before visiting so I ordered once I got there ( I should've visited yelp first lol). It took about 20mins for me to get my peach cobbler. Overall, it was just alright. I probably wouldn't visit again.",
            "Was introduced to The Peach Cobbler Factory by my friend. As soon as she told me, I knew I had to try it. I placed my order online so that when I got there it would be ready. My friend warned me ahead of time that this isn't a place that you could order and eat there. I didn't realize that this was a facility that multiple businesses were in. It was different yet kind of cool. I'd def take the chance to try out some of the other businesses also. I ordered the strawberry and peach cobbler with ice cream. It wasn't too sweet which was perfect to me. I'm not a huge breading person, so it had more breading than I like however overall it was delicious. I've already mentioned it to my mom and sister and can't wait to try their banana pudding and cinnamon rolls.",
            "The cobbler (peach) was okay. Great fruit to crust ratio but crust wasn't crusty- overall not sweet BUT i actually liked that. The \"okay\" is that it lacked other spices maybe butter too to really give it a \"best cobbler\" stamp of approval. Mrs. Smiths frozen does it better ijs. Location: Cool concept- it's a business within like a \"ghost kitchen\" setup. The technology and their delivery system work for me- used kiosk to order which was easy to use and food came out within 10mins. I was there 2:00 in afternoon- parking could be a problem after this time. No complaints just not sure I'd go back for cobbler.",
            "This was my first time here, I was not really impressed with the store itself, I past by it looking for it. It's located in a factory like setting and they need an overhead sign which they don't have. Once comparing addresses we decided to open the door and walk in finding we were correct. The business is more internet driven, one guy behind a screened desk directing everyone toward a kiosk for ordering. Different but it seems effective. The desserts were a little on the sweet side but I will definitely be back. This is a good find or choice.",
            "Ignoring all the comments about the location (okay, weird). But as my daughter just said: \"I don't think I could make something this bad if I tried.\" We got the namesake peach cobbler. Where was the flavor? Where was the sweetness? Not in our little paper cup. And the ice cream? Is there a sugar shortage? Tasted like frozen milk. Love the idea, but concept fails here. Would also help if it wasn't just in this \"take out lobby/warehouse.\" Oh well, we tried. Better desserts await!"

            "Legit my new favorite doughnuts. Better than any I've had. Fluffy like Krispy Kreme, but truly better flavors. I came in on Thanksgiving (god bless you all for being open) and even though they were low on stock, I had some pretty fabulous options. Pumpkin, Cherry Pie, lemon lavender, and chocolate sprinkles. INCREDIBLE. I've never had such flavorful, lightly sweet, perfectly crafted donuts in my life. The space itself is super cute, and the women who work there are wonderful. Kind, polite, enthusiastic. I called about 45 min after I left to ask about ingredients because my friend has a cashew allergy, and they happily looked it up for me and confirmed no cashews in their ingredients. Mostly soy based, FYI. So bright and friendly on the phone and appreciated the time she took to make sure she got me the right info. 10/10 would recommend A+ donuts, cannot wait to go back and get some more. It's dangerous that I live five minutes away but I'm also not mad about it ;)",
            "If this is what all of being vegan tastes like, sign me up (lol it's not, and don't). But these are possibly THE most flavorful doughnuts I've ever had - as in real, fresh, natural ingredient flavor, not just fried sugar bomb flavor (although there's a time and place for that too). We visited the first day they re-opened after the COVID-19 closure - aaaand they were sold out. So we returned the next weekend and waited in line for about 30 minutes before finally getting our chance. It's a clean and simple interior with lots of big pretty plants, a menu board, and a counter with all the fresh goodies lined up and waiting to be eaten! When we walked in, the trays for two of the flavors we wanted most were empty. We're so used to this happening (see: Brewnuts) but UNLIKE Brewnuts they had more ready in the back within 2 minutes. It's almost like they anticipated which flavors would be popular and planned ahead so that customers wouldn't leave disappointed. I appreciate that so much! Staff were very friendly and efficient too. Way to do business! We tried the maple cream, lemon lavender, blueberry cake, strawberry shortcake, banana pudding, and old fashioned cake. There wasn't a bad or even mediocre one in the bunch. These are very light and fluffy doughnuts, not heavy or dense at all. And again, the flavors are so fresh and well done that it really put them over the top. The maple cream was the sweetest of the bunch, and my husband and I both agreed that the strawberry shortcake was our favorite. We can't wait to come back and try more of their amazing flavors. Support black-owned businesses!",
            "I love The Vegan Doughnut Company! If you didn't know these donuts were vegan, you might never know. I'm not a vegan, but I sought them out once at a festival pre-covid because I wanted to see what the hype was about. I completely understand now why the line was wrapped around the building and up the street. Again, these doughnuts don't have some strange vegan-y aftertaste. To me, they taste just like the real deal, full of gluten-y goodness. My favorite flavor is the Lemon Lavender. These sisters make some truly delightful doughnuts in excellent flavors. You're also supporting a local, non-chain, black-owned biz and some really awesome ladies. I have yet to visit their actual brick-and-mortar in Lakewood, but I certainly plan to once the pandemic improves. Don't wait. Get there early or you'll miss out. Follow them on social media and you'll always be in-the-know on the rotating flavors and status of the shop. Afterall, they sell out regularly! A true Cleveland gem!",
            "Yum yum YUM!! As a donut fanatic I had heard a lot of hype around the vegan doughnut company well before I went in for my first visit. My friends and I planned to show up right at opening time (9 am) on a beautiful Sunday morning -- and when we got there the line was already AROUND THE BLOCK. We waited in line for ~40 minutes, but the moment we got inside, we knew the wait was worth it. All their donuts were beautifully decorated and consisted of more traditional flavors, but also, more unique ones. We ordered a box consisting of strawberry cream, cookies & cream, lemon lavender, maple cream, and more! They were all SO GOOOD-- the donuts were delicious, weren't too overly sweet, and I couldn't even tell that they were vegan. My favorite flavor was the lemon lavendar because it was a nice combination of tart + sweet. So before you go, make sure to double check their hours since they are pretty limited (and you should definitely try to show up early so the donut flavors you want don't run out). In addition, their menu is always changing, so you should look at their website or instagram page too for those! Fun fact: The two co-founders attended the same high school I went to in the Cleveland area, so that pretty awesome! Will definitely continue supporting them and am excited to see their business continue to grow",
            "Inconspicuous from the main road, I'd say this shop is a gem for the community especially transitioning vegans or vegans with a sweet tooth! Entering the shop is like going into a calm oasis. I loved the minimal, earthy, yet chic vibe. While no one was visible upon entry, I was still greeted almost immediately by two smiling faces that came from the back. With a perfect amount of options, this place has something for everyone, cake and yeast- based doughnuts with great flavors (both common and unique). The cookie butter is a cream filled doughnut and I appreciate the crumble on top. I love the passion fruit doughnut, but think it could've done without the sprinkles. However, they didn't detract, just didn't add to it. I'd recommend adding a fresh fruit like slices strawberries or blueberries if want to add color. The blueberry doughnut was a cake doughnut and familiar to taste, so good. Lastly, I went out on a limb and tried the lemon lavender and I must say it was magical! Sometimes less is more, and I think this spot has unlocked something great. IMO def better that Jack Frost and a contender with Duck Donuts. Thoroughly pleased and quite impressed. Vegan done right!"

            "Behold the almighty. If you know, you know. I'd like to introduce the Pistachio Cheesecake. This is a podium finisher gold medalist type of winner. Before coming to Villani's, I've never ever seen/heard of Pistachio Cheesecake. Being aloof, it took me a solid second to even give it a thought, not even coming close to giving it a chance. Slowly falling off their cakes since they hired a new pastry chef (their carrot cake used to be immaculate, but has since changed) I was running out of options. I've tried almost all their cheesecakes: blueberry, snickers, funfetti, raspberry, and butter pecan (banana cheesecake is on my hit list). And there it stood, solo solider, the Pistachio Cheesecake dialed into my eyes. I reluctantly inquired to a member of the bakery team and he said it's his favorite item and probably one of their best offerings in the entire bakery. Whoa. Wait what. This entire time I've been disacknowledging this delicious MVP and treating it like the last pick on a playground kickball team. I'll cut straight to the rating: 11/10. The subtle sweet + soft texture gets me every single time. This isn't a bang, rapidly in your face type of sugar rush like you get from other cheesecakes. The Pistachio Cheesecake is in its own lane, the far right. The best part - the graham cracker crust. Oh my goodness, combo the hard crust with the almost thick creamy like plush cheesecake and it delivers a sensation almost any human beings tastebuds would desire. Topped off with pistachio nuts themselves, this entire craft fuses together so delightfully. Again, it's a slow sweet injection that leaves you forking through the entire scrumptious slice. It's a mandate that I get two slices every visit. Due to its greatness, the demand is out of this world. By far the most popular treat at Villani's, I've struck out so many times in hopes to capture this gem. Crazy how at one point I wouldn't even give this thing a glance, and now I'm on a treasure hunt each visit in. Each time I walk in, Villani's team knows exactly what time it is and what I'm after. I can tell immediately upon opening the door by looking at their faces if I flipped heads or fails. I love how they get just as amped as me when it's a green light. It's hilarious. Big noteworthy: the staff at Villani's are exceptionally great people. I've been a fan of this bakery for a few years now and it's grade A+ customer service, fabulous personalities, friendly, nice, pleasant, charming, funny, all of the above. I've never been to a place like this, where every employee and I mean every single one of them are super socially cool individuals. You have to appreciate and applaud Villani's on that aspect and I believe that's by design. Personnel is so critical and it really creates all of the difference in Villani's makeup and brand. Honorable mention: The Napoleon. Best Napoleon I've had to date and nowhere else comes a close second. Their custard cream is stupendous. Other items that are big time that deserve recognition: brownies, s'mores bars, triple berry muffin, tiramisu, lemon bars, and pecan pie. Truly a boy meets wonder moment that first day being introduced to the Pistachio Cheesecake. Life altering for certain. If my parents or anyone else ever asks where we met, I can proudly say, \"At Villani's\".",
            "I have been waiting to try this place since moving to Charlotte. It's a good place for sweets and I'll for sure be back again. I would like to say that I'm someone who does not like overly sweet, sugary things. I grew up eating Japanese cake and sweets, if that gives you an idea. Said in bubble tea terms: I order my sugar 25%. 50% sugar is my max and this is only if I'm wanting that sugary taste. Cheesecake: First off, I was shocked that this place actually made baked cheesecake instead of the pour and cool in the fridge type. This is the type of cheesecake seen in Japan. However, the chocolate chips ruined it for me. You can't see it in the picture but the inside is PACKED with more chocolate chips. I felt like I took a handful of chocolate chips, shoved it in my mouth and then added a small bite of cheesecake. I tried hard to assess just the cheesecake portion but it was difficult. I *think* the cheesecake was ok? It was the right amount of sweetness and tartness. My husband who loves cheesecake and chocolate got this for himself and loved it. So I think I'm just the anomaly here. Red velvet cake: I'm a sucker for red velvet. The cake was SUPER moist. Just for that, I would get it again. The cake sponge was not overly sweet and I savored every bite. Downside: there was waaaaay too much icing surrounding the cake. I could not eat the \"spine\" of the cake with icing and tossed it out. But the amount of icing between the layers of cake was perfect. The icing is pretty sweet but it was balanced out by the cake. I just wish they didn't slather so much on the outside Cannoli: So this is made fresh at the counter and you can customize it however you want. Husband got the simplest-- sweet cream with chocolate chips. I think I'm just not a cannoli person. So I think it's unfair for me to judge this item. I will say, a lot of my friends LOVE their cannoli. And I have to admit, even though I thought it was meh, this was the first cannoli that was edible for me, which is saying a lot. So if you're a cannoli person, I would say, get it. Napoleon: Best for last. I can't even describe how amazing this was. It's a huge slice and I wanted another one. I can't stop thinking about this! The custard/cream was the perfect sweetness and the puffy layers were sooo good!! FYI, it gets a little messy to eat because the custard will leak out. But I love that they didn't skimp out on the custard. I will absolutely be craving and getting this again!!!! I honestly think I would have given this place a 3 star but this ONE dessert deserved a star of it's own. Overall, I thought this place was standard. I've definitely had better sweets from both Italian and French bakeries. But the Napoleon? Man, that was so good! I want to get several different items next time and reassess. With the Napoleon aside, this place got a 4 star because of their great and friendly customer service (some bakeries can be snobby and rush customers to pick their items), countless selections of baked goods, and the fact that they don't overly sweeten their items. Reading the other reviews here, hearing what my friends have said about this place, I understand that I probably do not have the palate of the majority. I can't in good faith give this place 3 stars because I am weird about sweets. But this definitely was not the best Italian bakery I have tried. Therefore, 4 stars.",
            "You've probably heard of places to die for so this place is definitely a place to live for LOL :D In all seriousness, it's quite embarrassing that it's taken me this long to finally write a review for an amazing bakery that is probably the best bakery in my opinion in Charlotte. Okay so this place is kinda inconspicuous when I drove by because I almost missed it and its very possible depending on which direction you're heading in. When you get there it's only 1 customer allowed in the shop so there might be a line but you'll always see people carry boxes of sweet treats! That's always a good sign from the multiple times I've been here! Once I got it, holy guacomole! My eyes got big and my tongue started to salivate from all the goodies that were available. They had cookies, macarons, cheesecakes, cannolis, and so many different things. They don't do dessert small here, more like loaded! I was so shocked at how big the cookies were like it could be the size of your whole fist! I've gotten macarons, cannolis, cookies, etc. They are all amazing but the one thing I have to recommend getting here is the tiramisu and creme puffs that are out of this world! I have a big sweet tooth and love dessert but man those 2 knocked it out of the park with how flavorful it was. Not too sweet but just the right amount like goldilocks haha Price wise it was very fair and the ladies at the counter will help you if you have any questions with a great attitude! I would say take your time here and just a get a few things because it all adds up $$$ real fast and same for the calories lol I'd say make it a trip and try something new each time you're nearby and they surely will not disappoint! Parking-wise is super easy since it's an open lot but there are a lot rocks so heads up if one gets stuck in your tire. But yeah they're doing everything right and really are a diamond amongst the dessert places in Charlotte and are a MUST if you're in town! That's all now excuse me while I schedule my next trip here haha",
            "YUM , Let me start off by reminding reviewers I'm gluten free soooo the delicious cakes, cookies, bagels , and other assorted pastries here I couldn't indulge in, but my family could and we all agree finger licking desserts . My flourless lemon cake was such a treat, it's so hard finding a good gluten free dessert, especially a moist, flavorful cake , and I was thrilled that my favorite lemon was available. This will definitely be my go to bakery when the need for a treat arises. The cake slices for the red velvet and chocolate cakes were HUGE, more than enough for two people to enjoy together, but if you have a serious sweet tooth I can see you devouring the entire slice because they both were perfectly moist and delicious . The service was friendly, fast, and both attendants were smiling . There wasn't any seating inside and only two tables outside so this appears to be more of a pop in and go shop. I loved the simplicity , made the desserts the main focus. If you're a coffee drinker there was coffee available as well, not sure on taste factor, did seem a bit pricey for regular black drip. I wanted to try the macaroons but I will save that for the next visit ... we will definitely come back . My kids want to try the strawberry turnovers and chocolate chip cookies as well.",
            "I am sold. This place is cute. These baked goodies are amazing and I haven't even tried them all. Somewhat hidden and off the main course in Plaza Midwood, sweet little Villani's is waiting for you to try. It's a quaint bakery. That's it. You can't sit down inside, but don't let that bother you, it's still worth stopping by to pick something up. The lemon bars : the best I've ever had. I used to get lemon bars from a more upscale grocery bakery and thought I was doing something right, but Villani's proved me wrong. Not only are their lemon bars cut larger, but you can tell the ingredients are better, and the dessert is baked better, doesn't come apart, doesn't melt easily or get gooey. SWEET BUT NOT OVERLY SWEET. The red velvet cake : it's a great cake. It reminds me of a cake you would taste a wedding . The cut is huge , and beautifully iced with a cream cheese icing, and again... SWEET BUT NOT OVERLY SWEET. Amaretti : something I never had before but enjoyed. When I saw this delicious little thing , I didn't know it was a amaretto macaron, I just thought it was a pretty cookie that I might enjoy. It's nice to have something every now and then that isn't traditionally 'American' and the Amaretti is just that. If you enjoy other European desserts, they have things such as cannolis, different flavors of macarons, Napoleans, etc. Plus more cookie flavors, muffins, puff pastries and TEA and COFFEE. Don't let it's small size fool you, there is a lot going on in there and you should check it out."
